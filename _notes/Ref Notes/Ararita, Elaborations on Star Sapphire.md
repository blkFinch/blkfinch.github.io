## Overview
An exploration of the Star Sapphire Ritual. Includes detailed commentary on the symbolism, how it fits into the tree of life, the purpose of the ritual- and suggestions on the actual sexual workings of the ritual
## Notes
### 16 - Signs and Signifiers can shift with the Aeon 
A sign is made of two parts, the signified and the signifier. The symbol is the signifier and it represents something. This thing being represented is the signified. For example, a stop sign can be described as having the signifier of a red octagon, and a signified of _stopping the car before driving through the intersection_.

The relation of these two aspects of sign are not universal and are not bound. Thus, as the Aeon shifts we can see that while the signs of a ritual remain the same, they may take on new meanings.

>Saussure (1857-1913), a Swiss linguist and considered the father of semiotics, suggested that a 'sign' is composed of two elements, the signtfier, and the signified.

>An example of this would be the shifts described by aeonic transition, where under the banner of a New Aeon certain 'old aeon' formula become inverted or no longer as culturally or magickally applicable, and yet the forms they take remain the same.
