Refers to the principle of correspondence from [[The Seven Hermetic Principles]] 

This principle was first mentioned on [[The Emerald Tablet]] an ancient hermetic text

The microcosm reflects the macrocosm and vice versa. This rule states that there are innate truths of the universe which are reflected across all planes of existence. What is true in heaven is also true on earth. This principle implies that we can conceptualize and make predictions about planes of existence beyond our mundane experience.

It also implies that our interior state will be reflected on the world around us. If I am compassionate I will feel as though the world is more compassionate.

It also implies that we can look at microcosmic behaviors and make predictions about the macrocosm.

### The Scientific Method 

[[Isaac Newton]] had his own translation of the Emerald Tablet, and most certainly understood the implications of this principle. It is this principle that allows physicists like Isaac Newton to observe phenomena on earth, and then apply those principles to planets and other large bodies in space.

>To the alchemist, the principle of correspondence reveals the link between the conscience and sub-conscience mind.Â  The work the alchemist does on the spiritual plane, building a relationship with the divine, moves into the mental plane, as an idea or intuition, then manifests itself on the physical plane. This is where the mastery of the principle of mentalism comes into effect. The alchemist is now able to see the positive and negative effects their thoughts and emotions have on the world around them. Through the principle of correspondence, the alchemist gains the wisdom to cut to the root causes of all things and solve all paradox.
