I spent a long time with many separate notebooks for different purposes- and this lead to a lot of unfilled and badly organized notebooks.

- the brain works by making connections across many varied thoughts
	- tasks and memories and questions all mingle together
- keeping the various _Areas_ [[PARA Organization]] of ones life rather than separate allows novel solutions to emerge
- benefits include more granular control over search capacity - search results can be filtered by type if needed for focus
