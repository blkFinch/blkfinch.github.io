The succubus as a concept has been much reviled. Many even contemporary magicians caution against mixing sexual desire with [[Internal Conscious Being]] work- or any form of [[Evocation]] . However many even non-magicians have had the experience of sexual encounters within the dream state, and [[Nothing is Evil]] -- so we should not shy away from working with these entities. 

Writers like [[Carlos Castenada]] and [[Faustus Crow]] (both potentially bad men, just to be noted here) both note that there exists entities of a feminine nature within the dream state that can act as guides or initiators or literal Gateways into lucid dream states or other [[Planes of Existence]] . It is possible these two see these initiatory entities as female, as a projection of ther Anima- and that a more feminine identified person may see these entities as masculine projections of their internal Animus.
