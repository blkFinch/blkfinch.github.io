### Determine Monophasic Sleep requirements
Everyone has personal sleep needs. To figure out your own-
- go to bed at the same time every night
- allow yourself to wake up with no alarm

This will at first allow you to __recover from sleep debt__ , and will eventually stabilize at a reasonable time: _~7-9 hours_

>All in all, keep this consistent monophasic habit **until** you figure out your actual amount of sleep duration and **no longer feel tired**.

>**NOTE:** Many sleepers directly jump into their polyphasic schedules with a **prior bad monophasic pattern**. As a result, they have already suffered sleep debts from the start.<mark class="hltr-orange"> Fixing your monophasic sleep first, if possible, is a more important factor than you think!</mark>

_takeaway: Go to bed at the same time, awake without alarm until recovered and consistent with wake time and no longer feel tired during the day_
