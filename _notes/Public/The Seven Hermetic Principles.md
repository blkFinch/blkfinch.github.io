### The Principle of Mentalism
The world is mental. Concsiousness preceeds material. [[Action is preceeded by desire]] . 
>The ALL... May be thought of as an universla, infinite, living mind.

-- The Kybalion

### The Principle of Correspondence 
There is always a correspondence between the laws and phenomena on the various planes of existence. This means that we can reason about the phenoma of higher planes by making observations on our planes. The macrocosm is like the microcosm. We can reason that the realm of the spirit behaves similar to the realm of the material. The relationship of cells within the body is like the relationship of bodies within a city... etc

**This seems to imply that our understanding of physics will probably need to shift so that we can see relationships between the quantum and the macro** 

This principle has been summarized in the axiom [[As Above, So below- As below, so above]]

### The Principle of Vibration
Everything is in motion- everything vibrates.

I believe what this is getting at is that ultimately all of reality exists like light photons in a wave-particle duality. There is no finite point only frequencies of vibrations that intermingle. 
[[Matter is just the spectrum of energetic vibration that is tangible to the mundane senses]] 

This is supported by my vision of existing along an infinite thread that stretches from the unity into dispersion.


### The Principle of Polarity

All things exist on a spectrum between two opposites. 
>Thesis and antithesis are indentical in nature but different in degree.

This means that oppposites are indeed the same thing just different expressions of the same "vibration"

### The Principle of Rhythm

High tide/low tide. Seasons. etc... All things change on a slower pattern. Masters should strive to not swing in seasons, but minimize their own rhythm. This is similar to what I was discussing when I said [[Magic is the art of making a true Decision]]

### The Principle of Cause and Effect

All actions have a reaction.

### The Principle of Gender
Gender exists on all planes and the interplay of penetrative and receptive is at the core of all generation and reproduction. Notably

>Everything and Every person contains the two Elements or Principles. or this Great Principle within (themselves)

Also another based quote from the kybalion:

>We caution you that this Principle has no reference to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust, licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for themâ€”Hermeticism contains nothing for you along these lines.
