Because of the nature of [[Hypersigils]] , by simply identifying with a character in a work we can begin to engage the [[Narrative-Limbic Feedback Loop]] which will cause us to have sympathetic effects from the work.

We can co-opt this fact to not only induce positive effects in our lives but negative ones too. If a bad thing happens to character we have formed a sympathetic bond with - we may experience these nagative consequences too.

__But can we use this to a positive effect?__

Yes I believe that rather than identifying fully with a character we can identify a character with parts of our personality we would like to change- and then the "negative effects" could actually be useful in manipulating these parts of ourselves.

*For example:* Jack in the Shining could represent Stephen Kings alcoholism- and by leaving him to freeze in the cold outside the Stanely hotel- King might have been destroying the unwanted parts of his personality.

>I think perhaps there are deeper levels of alchemy happening with really skillful writers. For example- King is an author that has struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. __The character Jack in The Shining is clearly a sort of self insert of his worst qualities. I wonder if by creating a negative hyper sigil like this and then leaving Jack to die in the cold- King was sort of "killing off" parts of himself that were no longer working for him.__ Maybe that in part helped him find his way to recovery.
