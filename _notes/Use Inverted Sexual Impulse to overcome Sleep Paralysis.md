The Inverted Sexual impulse I believe refers to the same inward orgasmic energy realized when performing [[Vajroli Mudra (Non-Ejaculatory Orgasm)]]

When experience a demon/monster experience in sleep paralysis use this impulse to destroy the fear.

This is similar to an excercise suggested by [[Crowley]] in Liber CL as [[A Method for meditating upon Love]], wherein two opposing ideas are brought to mind, and the aspirant should strive to be as desirous of both equally. Crowley I am sure is taking this concept from Vajrayana buddhism, I believe this excercised is mentioned in *Bliss of Inner Fire* by [[Lama Yeshe]] . #todo *find quote of this excercise*
