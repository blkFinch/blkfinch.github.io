[[Aleister Crowley]] famously stated that [[Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will]]. I am not sure I entirely agree with him. _Does magic necessitate change?_ I am not sure. However I do agree with his assessment that [[Magic]] is _both an art and a science_. Magic is a science in the way that a classical painter is a sort of scientist. In art there are theories that can be applied to create illusions of depth and form and light. In magic there exist also theories which can be applied to create other desired effects (and affects).

Magic as artform can be created as a _fine art_ or an _applied art_ - we can study its applications in culture similar to _folk art_. 

Magic as a broader field of study is rich and wide and I am surprised at its exclusion from the academic world. My dream is to see Magic treated with the same rigor and breadth as Art and Art History.

This line of thinking leads to considering possible curriculum for a degree in Magic and Ritual. Here is a rough idea of what that curriculum could look like

_b.f.a in Magic and Ritual Performance_
- History of Western Magical Traditions
- World Religions and Mysticism 
- A focus on a single cultural expression of folk magic
- credit hours in 101 level theater courses
- credit hours in any arts field
- Anthropology 
- Semiotics
- psychology
- anthropology of ritual and symbol
- modern applications of ritual
- technical writing
- science fundamentals (the scientific method and the ideas of academic rigor)
- philosophy

For the keystone project the student would have to create a symbol set (or use an existing one) and demonstrate proficiency with applying the symbol set in ritual performance or installation piece. The intended effect of the ritual should be clearly defined- and the results should be tracked and tested. The final assessment will be both on the aesthetics of the performance or installation, the thesis statement and demonstrated knowledge of the chosen symbol set, and of the record and paper written on the results of the ritual.
