We can create an [[Internal Conscious Being]] by using the souls ability to split off parts of itself (seen commonly as [[Soul Loss]]) 

Soul Loss, functionally, is simply a compartmentalization of some aspects of a persons full conscious functions. These functions continue on completely removed from our conscious awareness.

In shamanic modalities, this is seen as a sickness that can be cured through journeying and rescuing the lost parts of the consciousness, we can also use this feature to positive effect.

Using a ritual process like [[Creating an Internal Conscious Being]], we can take a function that is normally conscious and embed it in a compartmentalized and sub conscious  process- like a program that runs in the background (_literally a daemon in programming terms_).

Seeing the similarity in these processes raises some questions, and allows us to work with some deeper understanding of ICBs. Through this framing we can see why it would be dangerous to make a servitor with too much responsibility. Trying to split away too large of a part of our identity could cause a split in our identity and lead to schizophrenic like symptoms. (This might explain why [[The Dangers of Magic]] includes 'madness').

I wonder if it is healthy at all to participate in servitor creation knowing the negative effects of soul loss. Like so many magical activities, it seems to be overriding certain defense mechanisms of the mind.
