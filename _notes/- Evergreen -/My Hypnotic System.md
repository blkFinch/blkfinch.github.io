In order for healing to work there must be a therapeutic alliance. The Client needs to know that I know what is wrong with them, and they should be able to see that the logic within the particular modality I employee to diagnose and treat them should be consistent. To that ends I am developing an internally consistent modality of work.

I believe that using concepts like [[The Chain of Desire must be aligned for a desire to manifest]] along with the logical framework set up in [[The Master Key System]] will make a solid foundation for positive life coaching type work. I would prefer to stay away from *healing* modalities unless we diagnose a need for soul retrieval type work.

### The Offer

What can I promise

> You can be anyone, have anything, experience anything you can dream of. All humans have this natural gift, this full freedom of self determination. The ability to choose our life and live it. But the culture we live in, our trauma, our negative belief systems all work to prevent us from claiming this inner power.

### Diagnosis

If all people have this ability, then why are we not getting what we want? This process should always start with the questions developed in: [[Three questions to ask before manifesting]]

- **"What do you want?"**
	- if unclear on the vision- do desire garden work? I still struggle with this- clear away unneeded desires which hide true will (good time to use [[Sandra Ingerman, Soul Retrieval]] )
- **"Do you believe it is possible for you to have it?"**
	- Use [[The Chain of Desire must be aligned for a desire to manifest]] to determine where along this chain there is a limiting belief and target it
- **"Do you want it now?"**
	- if no or if there is hesitation, could come from fear, or limiting belief along chain of desire, or diffused desires.

If yes to all three- then simply do a hypnotic induction into the threshold ritual

### Theory
Based on [[There are three steps to every act of will]] and [[Conditions for a desire to manifest]]. As well as the idea that [[The Will acts through the rational mind which controls the astral body which acts upon the physical body]]

#todo: check out [[The Master Key System|The Master Key]] for breaking this theory down

- Our will is mediated through the creative mind
- The creative mind then acts on our subconscious 
- the subconscious creates whatever the creative mind tells it
- The creative mind must be focused otherwise the subconscious is pulled in many directions trying to create diffused desires
