The power of the Door, or threshold- is that it is a focused representation of [[The Will]]. We must choose to step through the threshold and once through it, we are in a new space. A place that is fundamentally seprated and different from the place we started. 

Since [[Magic is an expression of the will]] , this formalized positive action of crossing the threshold can be a powerful way of forming that will into a concise choice.

The ritual is simple:
- Become clear on the change or desire you want to bring about
- Before you, draw, create, or somehow visualize a door
- Know that on the other side of the door is the world wherein the change occurs
- Once prepared- step through the door
- close and banish the door behind you

>Build a door. Create in your mind, or draw it in the air, or build a frame or passage. Through that door is the life you are trying to build. Know this. Know that the person you will be on the other side is not the person you are now. Everything you are on on this side of the door stays on this side of the door.

ask yourself: _‘Am I ready to have this life - Right Now?’_
>
If you can answer yes- then step through the door and close it behind you. There is no turning back
