## Operation 1 - Building the Pyramid
>Death summons life and clears away all other forces. Death begins the operation with a knock, to which life answers. Then Death, banishing all forces external to the operation declares the Speech in the Silence
>- A.C.

The first operation is that of opening the temple.
To the southwest is **Isis**, who represents life.
To the northwest is **Hoor-Apep** who in some sense represents death.
[[Aleister Crowley]] here uses a symbol of Apep, the serpent god of death combined with Hourus in the new Aeon.This figure is Death however it is death understood not as an ending (Apophis) but also as the revealing of the sun (Hourus). _I don't understand Crowley's insistence on changing symbols to be more aligned with the "new age". Can't we simply change our understanding of the meaning of apophis? And I am not entirely sure the original meaning is missing what Crowley seems to imply it does by replacing with Hoor-Apep _

Thus the pyramid base is built- Hoor/Hades on one corner, Isis on the other, and the final corner is Thoth/Tahuthi. Above at the peak of the pyramid is Kether (HUA) 

## 2- Initiation
The aspirant is brought to the four princes of hell- guided by the voice of Isis who has prepared him. Not only the great mother but also his aspiration to rise, and achieve the great work.
