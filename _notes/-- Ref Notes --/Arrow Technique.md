Hypnotherapy technique developed by Freddy Jacquin.
Applications include pain, emotional distress, or any "blockage" that needs to be moved through.

It involves allowing the client to dissociate, and then imagine their pain as being in a target far away- then shooting through the center of the target and bursting through the other side into the new world.

Similar to [[The Threshold Ritual]] - the key is the decisive action to move to the other side of blockage. 

## Technique 
Check in first with level of pain between 1-10. Ask "Is this pain needed in any way?" As in "Can you live without this pain"
### Relaxation
Slow induction, focus on relaxation

### Dissociation
Ask the client to drift upwards and out of their body- far away. This induces a dissociative state

### Transformation
The pain is now symbolized by a target- far away. The most intense sensations in the center of the bullseye

>‘Now in your mind’s eye, I would like you to look down, and way, way down below
   you’ll see a target, like an archery target. See that target clearly in your mind; see the
   colored bands, see the bullseye, the centre of the target; now in that bullseye is the
   pain you were experiencing.’

### Emotion
Encourage an emotional spike as they pass through the target. "When you pass through the center of the target the pain may intensify for a moment - *be brave because this is the last time you will experience that pain*". **This focuses attention on the next moment**

Then suggest the patient will go into a world of no pain

### Distortion
The client is then encouraged to float in the new world where they no longer experience pain. Feelings of spaciousness, freedom, happiness, floating. Remind them of the faces of people they love and who love them. Pain leaves the body
*"As you gaze at faces of all the people who love you, feel all the useless pain leave your body- you can no longer experience it"*

### Double Dissociation
Point out to the client their body as if seen from across the room. Remind them they have no pain. See what they look like with no pain. When they are returned to their body- confirm that they will no longer feel that useless pain.
