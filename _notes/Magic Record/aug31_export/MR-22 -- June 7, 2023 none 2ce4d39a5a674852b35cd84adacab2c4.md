Title: MR-22 -- June 7, 2023 : none
Date: June 7, 2023
ID: MR-22
Activities: none

upset and impatient with how long it will take to be initiated as a neophyte. It will be another 7 months until I receive my initiation. I could have done it in november- but it would be scheduled at the same time as that wedding in mexico. I have a feeling I should go to the wedding, and I can sense it will be beneficial for me to learn patience with my development. 

I am frustrated nonetheless. everything seems wrong right now
