Ref notes

## evocation should cause physical manifestation of phenomenon 
The Solomonic evocation if doen correctly should cause actual visible and tangible manifestations. This can be full appearance of a spirit or appearance in a shew stone, mirror, or crystal.

*Appearance of other phenomenon like a change in temperature, odors or darkness are signs of early success but are not the final goal-- continue to refine the practice*

Causing a spirit to manifest physically will cause it to be more compliant with the request

> Solomonic evocation is reliant on a mechanic which at its essence consists of impressing upon the evoked a need for them to obey a call to manifest, and that this is done primarily as a means to ensure compliance
> - pg 10

## ideal locations for magical evocation
> Go to a proper place, in order to make the circle
I will tell you
about. Let the place be at the peak of a mountain or hill,at a
grove, at a plain, in a cave, near the sea, at a meadow, at a place
where somebody was killed in old times, at any place that is
pure and trackless, near a river or at a meeting of three roads
far from people, where the crow of a rooster cannot be heard
in order not to be found and obstructed by anybody.
The later Key of Solomon recommends a similar arrangement

Quoted from the Hygromanteia by Ody, pg 12

It is important for the space to be private, and that no unexpected visitors or extraneous activities occur in the space. This is to maintain the stability of the consecration and purification of the space.

## the first operetion- an evocation of Gremory in order to obtain a key with which to bind a king

Before attempting perform a 3 day retirement to purify. Abstain from sex and drugs.

*instructions for the ritual are provided starting on page 21*
