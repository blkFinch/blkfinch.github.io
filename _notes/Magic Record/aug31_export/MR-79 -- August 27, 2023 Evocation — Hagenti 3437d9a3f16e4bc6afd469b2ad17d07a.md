# MR-79 -- August 27, 2023 : Evocation — Hagenti *

Title: MR-79 -- August 27, 2023 : Evocation, lesser key
Date: August 27, 2023
ID: MR-79
Activities: Evocation, lesser key

9pm

H came and together we attempted to evoke the demon Hagenti from the lesser key.

I drew the triangle of art on floor in chalk and placed the black mirror inside it. beside it i lit a white candle. because hagenti is a spirit of a mercurial nature, I thought sandalwood would be good to burn as I did not have any storax.

H sat in front of the mirror Scrying while I sat beside him reading the invocations. The operations we performed:

- lbrp
- lbrh
- preliminary invocation: “bornless one”
- the first invocation

When I finished the first invocation H said he saw an ox in the mirror- H described what he saw while I took notes:

I asked for spiritual guidance on the nature of silence

- a chalice with water, wine is poured into the chalice
- a door opens, the door becomes a tunnel
- a candle
- he is being led by hagenti down a tunnel. hagenti wears a gold chain
- hagenti opens his mouth, h comments on his teeth
- dark sphere with gold in center
- hand holds sphere
- smell of roses and sulfer
- we are wrapped in white cloth
- the white cloth forms a U
- H drinks water, say Hagenti tells me to drink water
- “if there was a way it would be hidden, but there is another way”

During the session I realized that what H was describing sounded like hebrew letters: mouth - peh, door- heh, hand - caph, etc… I started writing these down without telling H. **notable**: I had forgotten to write down mem for water, and H said that hagenti was telling me to “Drink the water” he made this point as if he would not go on until I had. I was confused at first- but then realized that water had a hebrew letter association and wrote it down- H then moved on with the vision.

At the end of the vision my thoughts were confirmed when H said that on Hagenti’s medallion was a letter- he drew it for me: a perfect *lamed*

The letters I recognized from his vision:

| water | M | 40 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| door | H | 5 |
| candle | maybe I | 10 |
| mouth | P | 80 |
| teeth | Sh | 300 |
| hand | K | 20 |
| on medallion | lamed | 30 |

However when I tried a gematric analysis on this word I could not find anything particularly interesting. Adding the base values gives 485 which in 777 corresponds to “Mockeries”. Was this a joke? I don’t know. I tried using the ending values of the various letters and found no interesting results

Perhaps I will revisit this and try again in the future.

The word (in the order of appearance — corrected with water appearing first as in the chalice):
