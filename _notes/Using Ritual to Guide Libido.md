[[Libido]] , according to Jung, is not a directly controllable source of energy. It is more like a natural flow that will move towards areas where it is needed. This flow can become blocked or regressed by psychic barriers like trauma and unconscious objects of attachment. This blockage can cause depression, which is simply the lack of libidinal energy.

In this model of libido, the psychic energy itself can not be directed, instead the goal is to remove the blockages to allow the energy to flow freely to where it is needed. By removing fixations the overall access to libido will be increased.

Perhaps the symbols and actions of ritual magic become their own sorts of fixations and blockages which affect the flow of libido. It may be true that we can not consciously direct the flow ourselves but we could consciously create fixations that then guide that flow into the directions we will it.
