#todo *: clean this up*

The problem is not with the ritual but rather with the [[Desires]]. For a desire to manifest not only must it be physically possible but it also must be accepted by me. I believe the magic worked and the feeling of frustration is the magic working to bring the result but being blocked either by the confines of physical reality or by my own resistance to the success of the ritual.

My primary theory is that this resistance to success can be circumvented by creating a linked “chain of desires” by reducing the initial desire into smaller desires-( [[Desires are reducible into smaller sequences of desire]] )and then performing ritual to achieve the first chain in the sequence. or on whichever chain link is blocked

assume the following [[Conditions for a desire to manifest]]
- it must be possible
- I must believe it is possible

The solution then is to trace backwards the chain of desires until the link is found that does not meet the required conditions for success. Ritual can then be used to correct the resistance at that link and from there the rest of the chain should fall into place like picking the stuck tumbler of a lock.

__Furthermore I believe that this process can be formalized into a sequence of steps that can be implemented by anyone to discover if the chain of desires is clear and capable of sustaining success- and if not find exactly the link that can be corrected. see [[Is there a fundamental Magical Process]] __
