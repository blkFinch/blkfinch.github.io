[[Magic]] as an artform is composed of a handful of mental functions which are applied singularly or in tandem to produce the desired effect.

Here is a rough list of some of these techniques:
- **ego compartmentalization** as in [[Creating an Internal Conscious Being]] and [[Soul Loss]] 
- __Symbols__ implanting directives into the subconscious mind #todo _create note about the nature of conscious to subconscious mind- as in [[The Master Key System]] . The subconscious mind manifests blindly whatever the conscious decides is true._ This is typically done by encoding the directive into symbols (glyphs, sounds, or gestures often) and implementing them in a Ritual Practice - planting the directive in our subconscious
- __Awareness Shift__ Sending our conscious awareness into non-ordinary states (these can be elated, or catatonic)- can be _travel_ to new reams or a widening of the consciousness, or a shift in the locus of awareness
- __dissociative__ wherein the practitioner moves the locus of consciousness aside to allow another form of consciousness to take over as in invocation. Perhaps this can include evocation as well but it would piss off some magicians
