In hermeticisim, and western occult tradition at large, the four elements are foundational to many rituals. They correspond to the four suits of the tarot, to the four Kabbalistic worlds of the tree of life, to the four directions. This concept of four elements has come from ancient hellenistic philosophy. According to Bertrand Russel, it was the philosopher Empedocles who first suggested the concept of four "root elements" from which all other elements were.

Aristotle would expand on this concept later and describe each element as an intersection of two of the four sensible qualities: hot, cold, dry, wet:

| __element __ | __qualities__ | __suit__ | __domain__ | __animal__ | 
|----------|----------|----| ----|----|
| fire | hot, dry | wands | Creativity | lion 
|air | hot, wet | swords | Logic | man
|water | cold, wet | cups | Emotion | dragon
| earth | dry, cold | pantacles| Physical | bull

Important to note that while modern science has moved on from this simple concept of four elements, the idea that all of matter is made of a collection of "root elements" was correct.
