Creating a [[Internal Conscious Being]] is a common magical practice found across many paradigms and traditions. While the creation ritual and method varies, there are some commonalities we can point to:

### Generalized Ritual for Creating a Servitor
1. __Gestate__ - Imagine and design the form and function of the servitor
2. __Birth__ - Ritual "Birth" of the servitor; frequently involves charging a vessel of some sort for the body or home of the servitor.
3. __Naming__ - Typically within the same ceremony as the birth, but after the birthing phase, the servitor will be given a name, symbol, or other identifier and then given its task or duty. These signifiers and dutys should be chosen by the magician during the gestation period, and then spoken to the servitor's physical object or the mental construct.
