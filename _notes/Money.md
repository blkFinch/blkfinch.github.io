## money is an egregore that captures thought
Money seems to be a sort of spell or egregore. It creates the illusion that only those who have it have freedom- and it allows those who have it to have freedom.

It's certainly true that those with massive amounts of money can do whatever they want on this planet- but I think it is a false sort of freedom that without true spiritual freedom will only induce a deeper hunger. 

What is more insidiuos is the effect money has on those who lack it. It feels like we are trapped. That we have no real autonomy or ability to express our wills as we wish. This is false- it must be. I believe this feeling of "trappedness" is the actual point of money. It is a way of controlling

money is an egregore [[Egregores]] 

## money is useless
There is no need for money for someone who has connected with their own creative power. Money is only worth what it can be exchanged for- and in a fully realized human experience we will find the money we need in so far as it is applied to achieving our visions.

Rather than focus on money which reinforces lack- focus on the ideal and the ideal with manifest with or without money.
