### Positive Feedback Loops
We can use a robofish like technique in the blackbook to build a positive feedback loop when we do what we wrote about in the black book

> In this example, she is referencing recent sigil work she has done. Has it already started working? Perhaps. But she may also be working on building a feedback loop to help it manifest. She is also noting work that she has planned: the shoal for her kick-box ing. When she makes that shoal in a few days, it will reinforce the reality of all else she has written.

### Specifics take longer to manifest
More open ended manifestations will appear easier and quicker but if you have specific details that are important to you- focus on them. Just be aware that they may take longer to manifest. This could be ok though because when you get it will be exactly what you want

> **Wider nets will tend to produce more options and sometimes faster results**. This is easy to see around a relationship or work situation. If you know you like men, and you want to be into them and have them be into you, that's wide open. A great number of the several billion men on the planet could fit that bill. However, if they have to be Italian, a certain age, and of a certain means, now there are fewer potential partners for you to begin with. Expect that to take more work and effort. **This is not to say you should never be specific. Just keep in mind that focusing on the critical bits and being open about the rest makes for easier manifestations in many cases**. The same thing applies for a job. If you need a job that pays a certain amount of money for a certain amount of hours, that's a very wide net. If you need it to be in a certain part of town, in a certain field, and with many more particulars, that narrows the pool of options. Just focus on the critical elements. **If you have a longer list of specifics that are important to you, focus on those, and understand that changes may be slower to manifest. This may often be the better choice, however, in that you may end up happier with the results even if they take longer to achieve.**

### Telling True Lies
Intro spect about the stories we tell. How many are useful how many are not
> If we understand that the mind builds story continuously, the question becomes: does this serve us as is? Are the stories the mind is telling us useful and beneficial? If they are, we can carry on as we have been and let the process happen as it has before. If they are not, we have a choice to make: do we work to operate without storying everything, or will we work to control the narrative and therefore its effects?

The sorcerer was one who chose lots, and because he can not lie- what the sorcerer says shall always be true

> The warlock roots carried some connotations about lying and breaking oaths, and one translation I worked up was that a sorcerer or warlock was 'one who tells the truth by lying'. This was very interesting! Combined with the 'laying out' (i.e., choosing) one's lot, fate, or destiny ideas, these mangled attempts at magical etymology told a tale: The sorcerer is the one who weaves or chooses their own fate and makes it come to pass by telling true lies.

### The Blackbook, a Hypersigil
- Journal from point of view of the future
- focus on sensory experiences
- be free and creative


The black book is a hypersigil in the form of a diary. In it we write events we wish to happen as if they have already passed. It is important to add as much detail and sensory information to anchor the experience in our subconscious
> THE BLACK BOOK is a form of what is called a hypersigil. **A hyper sigil is a long-form narrative work of magic. In our case, it takes the form of a journal of events or things we would like to experience that haven't happened yet, written as a diary of things that have
already come to pass.** That may be a confusing concept, so let's break it down. Imagine you wanted a new guitar or another musical instrument. In many forms of magic, we would ask for what we want using a statement of intent, petition, or by evoking a spirit and asking for it directly**. In the Black Book, we will write about already having what we desire in our 'diary', in as much detail as we can. We embellish this 'diary entry' to such a degree that we can feel it, taste it, smell it, and we use certain cues to anchor the experience in our consciousness**. We work towards our desires through as many diary entries as needed, to flesh out all aspects of how we want things to be in our life. **We treat the Black Book in
specific ways to help it become and remain magically active**.

Its ok to not be clear about what goes into the black book. Its a safe place to experiment and try on new experiences. You may find over time that you enjoy writing about some fantasies more than others- this can guide your process.
> First, **you don't need to be one hundred percent certain of what you are writing, as long as the general tone and any specific critical points are right-on**. **You can use the Black Book to play a kind of 'game**' to see what you think and how you feel about the changes you might want to make. A good example of this is if you want to live in another location, city, or house. Perhaps you want a house by the sea but are open about what kind of house and which sea it is near. If so, you could imagine and journal about a stone cottage in Ireland, a condo in Florida, or a big house on the beach in Australia. **Over time, one of these might become a favorite day dream to drop into and write about.**
