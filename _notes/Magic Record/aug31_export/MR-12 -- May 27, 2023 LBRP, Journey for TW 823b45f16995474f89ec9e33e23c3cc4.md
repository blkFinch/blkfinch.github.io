Title: MR-12 -- May 27, 2023 : LBRP, Journey
Date: May 27, 2023
ID: MR-12
Activities: Journey, LBRP

LBRP performed in astral

called spirits. called Axtir who appeared in my mind as an eagle. He lead me to TW. Upon arrival I asked permission to enter her field. I felt her energy open and invite me inside. I then found myself falling.

I was on a river bank. TW as a child, maybe 8 or 9, has been hooked by a fishhook. She is scared and doesnâ€™t know what to do. There is another child there that seems to be teasing her. I wrap the child in bubble and send him away. I remove the fishhook. and console the young TW.

I then see her as she is now- but dressed in pith helmet and carrying a machete. She is hacking away at dense brush. I ask why she is not using the path that is well worn and I sense that she has immense pride in being self sufficient. I suggest that there will be time to use the machete but she should use the path that exists for her until she gets to a place where her skills will be better put to use. 

I return. I thank her and return to my body
