### The Principle of Mentalism
The world is mental. Concsiousness preceeds material. [[Action is preceded by desire]] . 
>The ALL... May be thought of as an universala, infinite, living mind.

-- The Kybalion

### The Principle of Correspondence 
There is always a correspondence between the laws and phenomena on the various planes of existence. This means that we can reason about the phenoma of higher planes by making observations on our planes. The macrocosm is like the microcosm. We can reason that the realm of the spirit behaves similar to the realm of the material. The relationship of cells within the body is like the relationship of bodies within a city... etc

**This seems to imply that our understanding of physics will probably need to shift so that we can see relationships between the quantum and the macro** 

This principle has been summarized in the axiom [[As Above, So below- As below, so above]]

### The Principle of Vibration
Everything is in motion- everything vibrates.

I believe what this is getting at is that ultimately all of reality exists like light photons in a wave-particle duality. There is no finite point only frequencies of vibrations that intermingle. 
[[Matter is just the spectrum of energetic vibration that is tangible to the mundane senses]] , [[All exists on a spectrum of vibration]]

This is supported by my vision of existing along an infinite thread that stretches from the unity into dispersion.


### The Principle of Polarity

[[Principle of Polarity]]


### The Principle of Rhythm

High tide/low tide. Seasons. etc... All things change on a slower pattern. Masters should strive to not swing in seasons, but minimize their own rhythm. This is similar to what I was discussing when I said [[Magic is the art of making a true Decision]]

### The Principle of Cause and Effect

All actions have a reaction.

### The Principle of Gender
[[Magical Gender]]
