#todo _create a better title for this concept_ 

Although [[Goetia]] and black magic in general is associated with "Evil" and "Dark" spirits or spells- Black magic is simply a way of describing a particular grouping of magical operations and spirits whose primary purpose involves manipulation of the material plane.

While [[Theurgy]] and other mystic arts are focused on elevating the practitioners conscious awareness, Black Magic is concerned with manipulating the astral plane in various way to cause effects on the material plane.
