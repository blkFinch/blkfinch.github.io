The practice of redirecting the male orgasm inward and upwards towards either mystical or magical attainments. 

[[Aleister Crowley]] seems to connect this with [[sacrificial magic]] in book 4 claiming he has "sacrificed thousands of babies" - although rather than retention here, he is mostly talking about ingesting the semen as a sacrament.
