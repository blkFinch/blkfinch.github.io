An imagined space that is consistent across visits. We can internally build a "palace" (although it can take any form) and visit it in our imaginations.

This can be used in many ways
- mnemonic device for remembering complex details
- a meditative technique (_i.e._ [[The Rosicrucian Grand Lodge]] )
- a place for visualizing solutions to problems
