In myths, trees are often depicted with people living in them or sleeping in them. For example, in the myth of Ishatar and the underworld [[Dumuzid, Husband of Ishtar]] is depicted sleeping under a tree and being entertained by slave girls.

How is he sleeping and being entertained by slaves at the same time? I believe this tree is symbolic of the Dream of Life. That the entertainment is happening in his sleep.

When I was in a state of heightened consciousness I experienced the feeling of being _inside_ a tree or actually _being_ a tree. With each branch on that tree a different Material incarnation- all growing at the same time.

Is this state of awareness being symbolized by Trees in myths when we are told that someone is _living in the tree_ or sleeping in the tree etc...
