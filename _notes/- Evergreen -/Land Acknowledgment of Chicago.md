><mark class="hltr-green">Chicago is the traditional homelands of the Council of the Three Fires: The Odawa, Ojibwe and Potawatomi Nations.</mark> Many other Tribes like the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Sac and Fox also called this area home. American Indians continue to call this area home and now Chicago is home to the third largest Urban American Indian community that still practices their heritage, traditions and care for the land and waterways.
