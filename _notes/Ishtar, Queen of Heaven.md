#### Inanna and the Huluppu Tree

Innana brings a tree to her garden and wants to make it into a throne but a snake, anzu bird, and maid live in the tree and it makes Inanna cry

>The woman planted the tree with her feet, but not with her hands. The woman watered it using her feet but not her hands. She said: "When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat?" She said: "When this will be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down?" Five years, ten years went by, the tree grew massive; its bark, however, did not split. At its roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest. In its branches, the Anzud bird settled its young. In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inana cried!

Innana asks gilgamesh to slay the serpent and he does, which causes the bird and the maid to flee.

Possible that the _maid_ is Lillith
