Intentions Goals and desires live on a spectrum of orderliness and specificity.

**Desires**
Desires arise from the lower senses and as such are based in material reality. For this reason they are specific and often times aesthetic.

_“I want a cute goth girlfriend”_
_“I want to eat sushi in Japan”_

Desires are not inherently ordered. They often times arise based on external stimulus. I see something attractive and I then want to experience it. This disordered nature of desires is such that [[desires eat each other when they conflict]]. If I desire to remain safe and also desire to do something that requires risk the two desires can prevent either from being fulfilled.

**Goals**
Once the higher consciousness begins to regulate the desires they can be ordered into sensical goals. Goals are less specific <why is this?> 
The vagueness comes from a an inability to see the true will

Goals are internally consistent

**Intentions**
Intentions are pure expression of the Will. Intentions are decisions, not based in desire or requiring planning or actions. When one intends to have water they simply rise and walk to the sink. In these moments all of the Will and Mind are coordinated and fully expressed
