[[Isaac Newton]] was working off the highly descriptive work of _Kepler and Kepler's Laws of planetary motion_, when he posited his Law of Universal Gravitation:

<em>Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them </em> 

This is the link that allows us to make observations about the motion of objects here on earth and apply those observations to the motion of planetary bodies -- [[As Above, So below- As below, so above]]

### From Laws of Motion to Universal Gravity

- Gallileo first started the study of Motion by watching falling objects [^1]
- Descartes contrinued the research with objects shot from slings
- Huygens continued with collisions [^2]
- Newton applied these observations to planets and worked with Keplars laws

>In the 1660s Newton had explored Kepler's laws of planetary motion. By working with the orbit of the moon he had roughly confirmed the idea that force acting on objects diminished inversely by the square of the distance between the objects

>__<mark class="hltr-pink">Newton's universal law of gravitation bridged the terrestrial and celestial realms in a single set of laws</mark>. By positing that an object's gravity pulled on other objects Newton simultaneously explained the movement of the planets, the comets, the moon, the earth, and the tides in the oceans__. _Principia_ provided a logic that explained the behavior that Kepler had documented in his descriptive work on the movement of the planets. At its time of publication, the book was controversial. In particular, the idea that objects could act on each other across a distance through empty space was unsatisfying to many. This action at a distance just violated conventional thinking about how forces work in the world. Descartes' model of the cosmos as vortices filled with matter was continued to be broadly popular in Europe and also had adherents in England.
