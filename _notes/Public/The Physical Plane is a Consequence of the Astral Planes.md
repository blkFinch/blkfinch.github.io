Instead of thinking about the Astral plane as a seperate plane that _can_ influence the material world it is actually more useful to think of the material world as _an echo of the astral plane_. 

That means that all of the creation of formal reality happens in the astral plane, hence [[Yesod]] (associated with this plane) is the _foundation_ of reality. Indeed in this regard we could say that all of our actual living experience is occuring in the Astral plane as this is the world we make decisions. The etheric and material planes are then the echos of those decisions. [[Action is preceded by desire]] . The movements of our subtle Desire Body creates forms in the Astral plane which then reveberate into the material plane which has captured our attention.

We can use this knowledge to our advantage- by lifting our conscious awareness up the astral planes we make more delibrate astral creations which will then cause the sort of material change we want. [[Shamanic Dreaming]] is based on this concept- where intentional creations are formed within the lucid dream state in order to use the effect in the material world.
