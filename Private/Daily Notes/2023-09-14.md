Levels of magic understanding:
- magic is literal
- magic is metaphorical and is coded instructions 
- magic is literal but the actions induce a somatic understanding of the metaphorical meaning

### personal os
It's nice to have seperate applications for specific purposes. Ex: using obsidian for note keeping, Google drive for storing large binaries, todoist for tasks --- but it would be nice to have a single software that coordinates all those pieces 

I would love to have an elegant and responsive interface that organizes my whole life:
- calendar
- tasks
- data storage
- notes
- reviews
- project management

__problem__: a single software solution usually is not the best tool for any specific job. Ex: notion can handle notes and tasks but it is not as good at either as obsidian and todoist respectively.

__solution__: a _yoke_ type software that can simply bind together many various productivity tools into a single *Personal OS* . 
*How to take smart notes*
