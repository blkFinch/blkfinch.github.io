## The Master Key System, Charles F. Haanel

The objective mind connects us to the external world and the subconscious mind connects us to the internal world
The conditions in the internal world affect the conditions in the outer world

>Someone may ask: "How can the subconscious change conditions?" The reply is, because the subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference is one of degree. The whole, as we know, is creative; in fact, it is the only creator there is; consequently we find that mind is creative, and as thought is the only activity which the mind possesses thought must necessarily be creative also

The Subconscious mind is actually connected to the greater consciousness. This is what allows subconscious activity to affect external conditions- the subjective mind is indeed directly connected with all other subjective minds.

>It is through the subconscious that we are connected with the universal mind and brought into relation with the infinite constructive forces of the universe.

The conscious mind perceives the conditions in the outer world, uses reasoning and discrimination to craft a narrative that is communicated to the subconscious mind which then goes about reinforcing those conditions

### The Tasks of the Conscious Mind
The objective mind has several responsibilities
- Discrimination
- Process sensory input
- Reasoning
- Seat of the will
- It can direct the subjective mind
