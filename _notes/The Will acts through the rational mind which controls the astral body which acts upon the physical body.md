As [[All exists on a spectrum of vibration]] , and that spectrum can be described in general groupings of vibratory rates known as [[Planes of Existence]]; How does a conscious mind exist and interact across these planes? How can [[The Will]] enact change on the Physical Plane?

To understand *how* [[Action is preceeded by desire]] , we can look to the various subtle bodies, or sheaths of consciousness. Because the densest vibrations of the Astral Plane can affect the Material Plane there can be crossover between planes. 

Our Will, which exists in the Spiritual Plane, has formed around it a sheath (or body or vehicle) that exists within the Mental Realm which it can control from the Spiritual Plane. This mental sheath then has around it an Astral sheath which can be controlled from the Mental Plane and again around this is the sheath of the Physical Plane which we call our bodies. *To be precise there is an etheric sheath between the astral and physical, and likely other finer sheaths between the Spiritual and the Mental planes*
