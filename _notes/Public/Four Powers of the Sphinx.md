The four powers to be mastered in order to not only do magic but to be a master of one's self.

- Knowledge (air), to know, *vide*
- Will (Fire), to will, *vole*
- Courage (Water), to dare, *aude*
- Silence (Earth), to remain silent, *tace*

Seemingly correlates to [[The Four Primary Elements]]. Very likely that anything that comes in fours in western occult tradition will relate somehow to the elements. 

## To Know
Knowledge is power. In an occult context, this is meant in a very literal sense. To control an element one must have knowledge of the element. There is sometimes a disparaging idea cast about in occult circles that a Wizard is one who Knows how and why a spell works, and a sorcerer is simply one who casts the spells of others. The implication is that having knowledge of the fundamental processes at play allows a wizard to create and change rituals and spells to suit the specific cases. I don't think this usage is common anymore as there is a resurgence in popularity of the term sorcerer. 

I also often hear magicians suggesting that incantations and barbarous names work almost by nature of their "vibration" and need not be understood. *To Know* , being a fundamental power of the magican implies otherwise, and Crowley directly states in [[Liber Samek]] that all the incantations must not only be understood but deeply internalized.

- In [[Raja Yoga]] , it is thought that having knowledge over an element allows the yogi to control it
- in [[Rosicrucianism]] it is suggested that deep meditation on an object will give you knowledge of the object

## To Will
[[The Will]] is a fundamental occult concept. In the context of the Four Powers, it implies that the will is meant to be used. That every action should be a conscious and willed choice.

## To Dare
This is the second part of To Will. Once we have chosen and decided to act then we must act. This is the Action that follows intention ([[Action is preceeded by desire]]) 

## To Keep Silent
An interesting rule and one often associated with the vows of secrecy taken within initiatory orders. 

Very likely this also refers to inner silence. The silencing of the inner monologue.
