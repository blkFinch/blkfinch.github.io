Magic alters pre-material conditions to cause material expressions to manifest([[Magic Aligns The Personal Chain of Desire]]). Because all things material must eventually come to us through material- they are still bound by the laws of the material plane. 

What is possible is broad however, and this principle explains the axiom [[Knowledge is Power]] , for if one knows the processes through which something could happen- they can then perform magic to alter and affect those processes.

Don't enchant for something and then DO NOTHING about it. You can't meet the
man/woman of your dreams by sitting at home all night, you can't pass that
physics test by not studying. You can't get a big pay raise by always
showing up late for work etc.. As your workings become progressively more
difficult seek to tip the hand of chance by creating "avenues of
manifestation" ï¿½ help the universe give you what you want.
