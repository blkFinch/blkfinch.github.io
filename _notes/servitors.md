 (see: [[Creating an Internal Conscious Being]] ) 
This is a conscious non material entity created by the magician. 
There are many theories and versions of this concept: tulpas, and Bardon's elementals and elementarys are the same concept. 

While many magical paradigms have slightly different theories and understandings of this concept, servitors are generally considered to be both _part of_ and _functionally seperate from_ the magicians conscious identity. It is as if we have chosen to partition a piece of our consciousness off into the servitor so it can function unimpeded by other parts of our ego.

I imagine this could lead to unwanted effects if overused or misused.
