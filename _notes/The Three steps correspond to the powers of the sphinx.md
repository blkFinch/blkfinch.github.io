According to [[The Master Key]] to manifest our will into the world we must complete three steps:

1.  Have an earnest desire
2. Develop a confident expectation
3. Make a strong demand


We can correlate these to the [[Four Powers of the Sphinx]] :

1. Feeling - _to dare_
2. Thought - _to know_
3. Will - _to will_

_so what then of silence?_

Perhaps here the silence refers to Faith. To wrap the whole process in the silent expectation?
