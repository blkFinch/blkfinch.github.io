The mechanism through which phenomena like [[The Magic Circle]] operate is [[Imagination]]. This is our ability to contain [[The Will]] . It is actually through this limitation of the Will that we are able to truly create as [[Limitation leads to freedom]]. 

Without imagination, all possibilities exist in the infinite field of unformulated matter- [[Binah]] - it is imagination itself that collapses the field of possibilities and defines what is possible in our material state.
