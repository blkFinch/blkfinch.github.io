[[Desires]] and [[The Will]] are two seperate concepts, although they are often mixed together and used interchangebly (esp by Thelemites). This is not useful. There is clearly a difference because we can desire things which prohibit our own true expression. 

However, because [[Action is preceeded by desire]] it must also be true that for the Will to be expressed it must generate a desire towards action. But not all desire is preceeded by Will.

Will is like an organizing principle that uses Desire as an interface to express itself.

__Not all Desire is an expression of Will__ though . 
Desire can be caused by external influence as well. It is like a public api for action.
