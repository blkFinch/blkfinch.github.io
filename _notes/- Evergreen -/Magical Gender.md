Many magical and occult texts and teachings involve references to gender from ancient times into the present. This _gender_ I think is a poor naming convention because I think it distracts much of the time.

A more precise naming convention would be __active and receptive__. For example we can look at the process of materialization in the [[Undifferentiated Field]] and see that for form to emerge from nothingness there must be the form, and that which is not the form (_negative space_). The form is actually shaped by what it is not and animated by what it is- so that both the shaping and the animating are essential in its existence. This is what is meant by Gender in the magical sense.

### wild man and wild woman
The wild woman energy is like kali- that which cuts and destroys and is undulating and ugly. Wild man energy is generative- that which fucks and ejaculates with no reserve 

### In the Kybalion
Gender exists on all planes and the interplay of penetrative and receptive is at the core of all generation and reproduction. Notably

>Everything and Every person contains the two Elements or Principles. or this Great Principle within (themselves)

If we also apply the [[Principle of Polarity]] we can see that gender is not a binary force but a spectrum.

### References

>We caution you that this Principle has no reference to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust, licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for themâ€”Hermeticism contains nothing for you along these lines.
