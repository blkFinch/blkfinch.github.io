# The Three steps of Creating yourself

## 1. Surrender / Willingness

We must be willing to let go of what we have to become who we want to be. The place to start is by asking ourselves “by not having what I want, what am I gaining?” so that we can see how our story of lack is serving us. Once we see that what we gain is not worth what it prevents us from having, it should become much easier to surrender and let go of our stories, and ego fears.

## 2. The Vision

We must construct a vision of who we want to be, or what we want to have. This vision must be something we believe is possible, and we should spend much time in this vision- strengthening it. This is what vision boards, and day dreaming are all good for.

Many magical scholars have already pointed out that [[For magic to work the result must be possible]]. But I will put forward the idea that not only that- *we must believe it is possible* . There are many things we are capable of doing that we prevent ourselves from experiencing simply because we lack belief in ourselves or our ability to experience it.

I would argue too that because of the law of correspondence ( [[The Seven Hermetic Principles]] ) it is true also that what is truly possible within mundane reality is also a result of underlying belief structures

## 3. The Decision

we must decide to have. to make the choice we must exert will. Stepping through the door is an act of [[The Will]].
