The amazing power of our minds and [[Imagination]] allow us to freely move about in many different [[Planes of Existence]]. 

see,  [[Astral Travel]], for examples of ways we can do this.

Perhaps it is this quality that makes being incarnate so desirable. #todo : _source?_ 

### During astral attacks
Because of this quality, incarnate beings are very adaptable at defending themselves in the various astral and mental planes because we can simply leave and travel to another plane. 

Non incarnate entities tend to be stuck to the plane they are  part of and will be unable to follow.

>How serious are these astral combats? They do seem to be very serious when they happen, and there is adequate evidence that these incidents are true astral occurrences and not nightmares. But as an incarnate human being you have an enormous advantage, in that all the levels of exis- tence are open to you, from the terrestrial to the divine. You can, literally, escape to another world from your attacker. You can drop back into the physical, as Robert A. Monroe describes himself as having done, in the chapter "Intelligent Animals" in his book Journeys Out ef the Body (page 143), or you can force the fight up to a higher astral level as the anonymous woman narrator evidently did in one of the histories in The Triumph of Light, Book IV of The Magical Philosophy (page 241). On the whole, the technique of going higher is more highly recommended, as such vicious entities are, by nature, of the lower levels; they can thus be thrown off and discouraged from further attack.
