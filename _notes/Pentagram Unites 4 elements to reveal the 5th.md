The pentagram ritual brings 4 elements together to reveal the 5th

The ritual arranges each of the 4 elements around the magician, then the 5th element of spirit is identified as the 6 rayed star.

It follows that the Hexagram ritual works in a similar fashion with a 6 point star revealing the 7th manifestation.

> “We might add that the Pentagram ritual brings the four elements together to produce/reveal the fifth (which itself identified as a hexagram 'In the column stands the six-rayed star'), whilst the Hexagram ritual, particularly the Star Sapphire works with the sixfold star to produce a seventh 'point', found graphically as the rose at the heart of the 'unicursal hexagram'.” pentagram ritual unites 4 elements into the fifth (the hexagram)
