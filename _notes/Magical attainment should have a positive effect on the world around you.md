Magical attainment of any sort whether [[Samadhi]] or recieving [[Knowledge and Conversation]] or any revelatory vision can manifest differently for every practitioner. This can take the form of direct or symbolic messages in the desire body or as a deeper sort of understanding. but the real measurement of the attainment is in the actual effect it produces in the practitioner.

A true attainment should be seen in the world around the practitioner as they will act on their environment to improve the conditioner of the universe. They become vessels for the ray of light they have obtained it will shine through them to the material world.

>_It is a fact that one of the forms of 'Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel' occurs in the plane related to the Desire Body, and that a symbolic form of the 'Angel' can then appear to the aspirant. But as it is written, 'Knowing them by their fruits', the validity of any mystical or magical experience is in the evolutionary effect it produces in the personality of the person who obtains the experience._

  It does not matter, from the point of view of humanity (or from the point of view of the Universe), whether our spiritual rapture was beautiful or delightful. What matters is whether it was environmentally friendly. The initiates define the spiritual advancement of the human being as greater efficiency in the promotion of universal harmony._
 **If the rapture does not bring benefits to the universe in which you live, the formula that composes it is not Love, which presupposes interaction and communication, but Hate, which presupposes separation**._
