Because of the nature of content focused social media platforms, users are incentivized to put out a lot of content quickly. Audiences find creators who speak off script and "authenticaly" to be more trustful. 
For example, the standard format of most tik toks is an unscripted talking head of a creator giving their gut reaction takes on some matter.

This is not good. It means that we'll research, though out, and nuanced opinions often get overlooked by the algorithm leaving the Overton window of discourse to hover around what often the most emotionally satisfying opinions.
