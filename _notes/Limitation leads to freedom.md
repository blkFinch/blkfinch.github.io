In *The 12 and 12* the authors write, regarding the 3rd step, that choosing to bind our will to something greater can lead us to greater freedom. They give the example of the electric grid. When we connect our house to this grid we no longer have the freedom to just travel with our homes like a nomad but we gain access to such a great power that we have even more freedom to perform other functions.

In the OTO this sentiment is repeated as one of the initiated secrets.

Yoga means "Yoke" or to bind-- refering to *binding the mind* so that we can get liberation from mundane life. 

In describing [[The Magic Circle]], Crowley notes that it represents *Limitation* and *affirms the Magicians commitment to the great work*. This limitation and oath making of the magician are indeed acts that grant him his freedom.
