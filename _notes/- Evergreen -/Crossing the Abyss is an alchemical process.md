#### The Abyss
My initial understanding of the abyss is that to send our consciousness into a plane of awareness that precludes singular ego, we must leave behind our sense of identity and our ability to perceive and experience as a singular being and enter into a state of existence that is fundamentally unknowable and indescribable as a human. Thus the abyss represents this gap, where all experience on each side must stay on that side. 

#### Prometheus
While natural language falls short of being able to describe the experience of existing in awareness of the supernal triad, our inmost self carriers the experience with us back into daily life- and thus the myth of Prometheus is born. The fire which he stole from heaven was the knowledge of non-dual reality

#### Alchemy
Crowley talks about the madness incurred when crossing the abyss. The way Crowley talks about crossing the abyss, he treats it as a long alchemical process. As though his actual ego attachments are being dissolved. He even describes it as akin to madness.

This makes me wonder if my experience in LA was an abyss crossing. If so then it means that we must have many abyss to cross, and on the other side of each we find ourselves again in [[Malkuth]] but in a higher plane because we now have the knowledge we gained in the supernals.
