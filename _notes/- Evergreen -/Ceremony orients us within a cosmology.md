When we perform [[Ceremony 1]] -  [[Ceremony centers us within the material and temporal universe]]

This informs us of a way of seeing the universe. The more that we perform a ceremony that conveys a specific cosmology- the more we become attuned to perceiving the universe as existing within that framework. 

__When we have a subconscious cosmology it allows us to organize and understand the universe__. If we only understand the universe of being either good or evil- then anything we perceive to be _ungood_ is therefore _evil_ . This is common in modern American flavors of christianity and is a quick path to radical ideology.

Having a consistent cosmology is important to ceremony because the ceremony will reinforce whatever cosmology we set up. If we place Air to the east, we should always place air to the east because this will strengthen our conviction and understanding of the universe.

We should keep our cosmologies consistent- __simply mixing and matching may create a muddy focus__.
