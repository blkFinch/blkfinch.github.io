The world has within it light and dark, but niether has any intrinsic moral value.

We should not shy away from experimenting with parts of the world that we find distasteful, or if not perform personal experiments we should not deem those who do perform works like [[sacrificial magic]] or working with demononic [[Goetia]] as somehow evil or on _the left hand path_ . Indeed [[Black magic is focused on material results]] nothing more and members of the *Black Botherhood* are simply those magicians who have become so obsessed with their material identity they become wrapped in the bondage of the ego.
