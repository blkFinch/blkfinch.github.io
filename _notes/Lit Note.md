A simple [[workflow]] for making and using Lit Notes:

1. Find interesting article/book/video/whatever
2. Create [[source note]] for it (others call this a reference note)
3. Take notes directly in the source note
4. Clean up the notes in the source note and distill them down to core idea    
5. Extract each core idea into a single separate literature note
6. Create evergreen notes that refer back to one or more literature notes from one or more sources
