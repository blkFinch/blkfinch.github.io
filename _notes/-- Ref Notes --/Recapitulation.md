 A technique described by [[Carlos Castenada]] . It involves imagining a memory. Visualize the memory as if it is happening before you. Turn your head to the right and then take a deep breath in as you sweep your head to the left. Imagine drawing in any and all lost energy. Then exhale as you sweep your head to the right and return any energy that is not yours back to the memory as it sweeps away.

The main purpose of this according to Carlos is to reclaim lost energy. The primary concept of Castaneda's cosmology is that magic requires lots of energy that is lost and leaked in many ways- so the sorcerer must reclaim as much as he can.
