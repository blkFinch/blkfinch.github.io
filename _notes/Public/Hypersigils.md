A hypersigil is a type of [[Sigil]] or encoded [[Desire]] that is encoded not as a visual symbol but as a narrative or any work of art that changes. The desire is conveyed through narrative tools like character and drama, but these tools can be applied to any work of art like music, dance, or performance - not just writing. 

The theory behind hypersigils is closesly related to the idea of Anti-Mimesis or [[Life imitates art]]. If the natural world  will inevitably form itself around art then it makes sense to create art in a way that will cause the world to change in a manner in accordance with our desires.
