## Schedules

Many different patterns have been developed. Important for me is :

### E1
__core:__ 23:00 - 5:00
__nap1__: 14:30 - 14:50 

_everyman 1_ is a biphasic sleep schedule with an everyman style nap. Shortened core sleep to help induce REM napping

__goal__:
- Give REM sleep in the nap (ideally)
- Ease new polyphasic sleepers into daytime napping.
### Everyman 2

__core:__ 23:00 - 3:30
__nap1__: 8:00 - 8:20
__nap2__: 14:30 - 14:50 

This schedule seems attainable. A large core sleep to reduce sleep deprivation, but still a substantial increase in awake time. Ideally this would be enough for me to train falling to sleep fast without severely damaging my productivity during work hours.

- large quiet work time in morning, once adapted
- REM naps good for dreaming, twice a day
- Movable schedule easily (_core can shift early or later depending on schedule/tiredness_)

## Stages of Sleep Adaptation
#todo [read this](https://www.polyphasic.net/adaptation/)
each stage is about 6 days (__shorter on more extreme schedules__)
1. easy, more productivity -- however no compression on REM
2. tiredness during day, hard to wake up, easier to fall asleep, waves of tiredness
	- waves of tiredness eventually align with sleep schedule
3. oversleeping occurs- set alarms -- big fail point
4. waking is easier, patterns of tiredness are obvious, more [[Dreams]] _not complete adaptation_

#### Sign of complete adaptation
- energized and productive
- wake up feeling refreshed
- natural wakes
- lots of dreams and dream recall

## considerations

- must quit caffeine before attempting. It will affect schedule
- learn to nap _first_ (get up earlier than usual and allow myself an afternoon nap (basically start with a gentle biphasic sleep pattern)) [[How to nap]]
