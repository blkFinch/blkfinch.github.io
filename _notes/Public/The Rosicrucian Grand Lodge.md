AMORC, a sect of [[Rosicrucianism]] and a fraternal order has a book desdcribing an astral meeting place. It is visited through what seems to be a form of [[Astral Travel]]

A spiritual plane- it is a shared plane and all who seek to commune with the spirit are present here. To ascend:

-   wash hands to symbolize purity of the body
-   drink water to represent a desire to be pure internally
-   recite the following:

> May the Sublime Essence of the Cosmic infuse my being and cleanse me of all impurities of mind and body, that I may enter the Celestial Sanctum and attune in all purity and perfect dignity. So Mote It Be!

-   then rise above the earth
-   enter the holy place and envision the beauty and feelings of spiritual inspiration
-   then enter into communion with God

### Entering through the hypnagogic state

[[Paul Foster Case]] notes that the gate to this temple is depicted on the 18th key of the Tarot. This is the Moon card and is associated with the Hebrew character _Qoph_ which means 'back of the head'. It is likely that this is a reference to the "falling" sensation that occurs during the entering of the hypnagogic state during [[Shamanic Dreaming]]

>Yet there have been critics who say the manifestoes must be a hoax, because nobody ever saw The House of the Holy Spirit! In truth, it is probable that considerably more than a hundred thousand persons have seen it by this time. Thousands of others, though some nearly see it, do not, after all, behold that glorious structure. Let it be ours to affirm that it is a real building, though unseen, more marvelous than any of this world's other wonders. ==Let it be ours to declare that the way to it stands open today, as in the past, and that none shall fail to find it who seek diligently in the right direction. And the path that leads to it is the path pictured in the eighteenth Tarot Key==
