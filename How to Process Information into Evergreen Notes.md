First, reading a source we process it into a [[source note]] 
Then that source is turned into a seperate [[Lit Note]] for each note I took while reading
Those notes can be used to construct an [[Evergreen Note]]

_consider using folders to display the state of processing for a note : one folder for inbox, and a folder for complete_

>How I built these:
	- I stumbled across this concept somewhere and thought it was interesting, decided to look into it
	- I quickly found a list of several conference slides and white papers on the topic, largely by the same author
	- After looking over them I decided to start processing them as sources, so I created a source note for each one I decided to read
	- In the source note I snagged quotes, images, etc in the `Excerpts & Quotes` section and also wrote my own thoughts alongside them
	- I then aggregated these raw notes up into summaries in the `My Notes` section
	    - Summaries may or may not contain quotes/images - in this case they do because the quotes/slides are information rich
	- Once I had them summarized I converted each into a lit note using the Note Refactor plugin in Obsidian
	    - This leaves the `My Notes` section relatively empty except for links to the generated lit notes
	    - So I now have bidirectional links between the source note & its associated lit notes
	    - Source note may still have some "raw material" at the bottom that I decided was not worth processing, but may be interesting if I stumble across it again later
	- Source note folder is moved into a "completed" folder
	- Repeat for each source note   
		- Once I felt I had read enough to understand the concept (signal: some of the material started getting repetitive) I made a couple of evergreen notes capturing the overall ideas
	    - I think I made one of them about halfway through processing the sources, then the other at the end to summarize the concept
	    - The evergreen notes are different: 
	        - One is an overview of the concept and links to several lit notes from multiple sources in an outline, because that is the most reasonable way to present the material       
	        - The other targets a single principle that came up repeatedly in the sources, so it describes the principle and then is sourced to multiple lit notes
