I previously said [[Chaos Magic is Post Modernism applied to Magic]]. I think that is incorrect. I believe that Modernism in the magical world is the quest to simplify and to cut out all the unnecessary parts of magic- to distil magic to its core. In this sense [[Chaos Magick]] , and the Ideology of Chaos Magic, is truly an expression of Modernism.

Post-Modernism in the magical world is closer to what [[Frater Acher]] is doing in his work with reintegrating magical practice with lived experience. The acknowledgment that magic can not exist without culture, and that attempting to sand off the "superfluous" edges of ceremony is losing something fundamental to the magical process is a new paradigm that falls neatly in line with the Post Modern framework.
