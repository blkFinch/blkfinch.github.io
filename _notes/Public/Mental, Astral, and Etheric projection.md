The three sorts of projection are often conflated with one another. These terms are the most standard that I can find

-   Mental: Uses the imagination and symbols to communicate meaning. Feels like Daydreaming.
-   Astral: closer to lucid dreaming. Can experience actual parts of physical plane from the astral
-   Etheric: Full embodiment in the etheric body == OBE

## OBE
When consciously entering an astral projection or OBE experience- one begins by first relaxing to the point of sleep paralysis. 

### Signs of incoming OBE:
- Tightness of throat
- anxiety
- Vibrations that increase in intensity
- flashing light
- falling sensations

### References
> Mental Projection, concerned mainly with exploratory acts of skrying or the using of symbolic doors as an aid to understanding a particular part of the astral plane. This is 'projection-by-symbol'.

> Astral Projection (proper) in which the astral body (or Second Body to use Robert Monroe's term) (5) is able to move a distance from the physical body and accurately report what it sees on the physical plane, facts that could not have otherwise have been ascertained by the apparently sleeping practitioner. There is little restriction on the distance the astral body can travel.

> Etheric Projection, in which the physical body is reduced to a state resembling catalepsy (the breathing in fact becomes very shallow and may cease altogether for some time). Meanwhile, more of the basic 'etheric' substance (6) is extruded from the body and accompanies the consciousness a limited distance from the body.
