An experimental group working around developing a pantheon of [[Egregores]] and [[servitors]].

The working revolves around choosing the appropriate egregore for the "color of magick" you wish your servitor to be a part of. Then doing a  fairly standard "charging ritual" [[creating an Internal Conscious Being]] 

>Ritual For Servitor Creation
>
To create your servitor, you will need the following:
>
● The sigil of the egregore you are drawing from
>
● A pen and paper
>
● Components which represent the color you are working with
>
● Any suitable offerings you wish to give to the egregore
>
>1. Perform a banishing of your choice.
>2. Place the egregore's sigil on a suitable altar or on the floor in front of you. Say, “Council
in [color of magick], I call upon you. Grant me now your assistance as I create this
servitor.” Tell the egregore your individual purpose for the servitor you will create.
>3. Place the representative components before the egregore. As you place each
component, tell the egregore what that component represents. After each component is
placed, say, “By utilizing these components, it is my will to create a servitor which will
assist me in my pursuits of [color] magick! Guide me now, Council in [Color], as I
establish my link to you.”
>4. Begin chanting the formula of calling for the egregore you are working with, either aloud
or mentally. Concentrate on summoning forth the presence of the egregore.
>5. Enter gnosis through any suitable means. Upon reaching your gnostic state, give your
servitor its name and sigil as revealed to you by the egregore.
>6. Charge your servitor by saying, “Servitor, you have been created by [Your Name]. By my
will, I name you [Servitor’s Name]. You are [Servitor’s Name], and I, [Your Name],
charge you with assisting me in my pursuits of [color] magick. By assisting me, so shall
you add to the collective understanding of the Council in [color]; by my will, it is done!”
>7. Meditate for a short time over the power you have exerted and over the servitor you
have created. When you are ready, give thanks to the egregore and say, “Council in
[color], by your understanding and by my will, [Servitor] is created to empower both my
magick and your consciousness. So it is done! Council in [color], I thank you and give
you now license to depart.” If you feel so inclined, now is the time to give the egregore
any appropriate offerings. When you are ready, close the ritual.

AFAIK this is an experiment created by magicians from the Faith Blind Podcast.
