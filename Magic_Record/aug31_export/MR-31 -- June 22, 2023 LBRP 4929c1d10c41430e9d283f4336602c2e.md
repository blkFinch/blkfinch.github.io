Title: MR-31 -- June 22, 2023 : LBRP
Date: June 22, 2023
ID: MR-31
Activities: LBRP
Time: 3:30 pm

upon arrival in my hotel in Syracuse NY I performed lbrp in the hotel room. I had a lot of anxious energy.

After banishing I laid down and tried to listen to my guidance. I felt like the energy that flows through my subtle body was shaky and unsteady. I wonder if my constant experimentation with various magical modalities is causing a diffusion of my power. I tend to approach magical practice with a small amount of cynicism- as if I can understand the underlying truth of the various practices without needing to be an adept on that specific path of teaching.

I have been humbled by seeing the power T displays in her sincerity and commitment to tradition. I should whole heartedly commit to my studies and truly be able to properly perform the ceremony I practice.
