During [[Ceremony]] we often place representations of the universe around us. ([[Fundamental and common elements of Ceremony]]) placing us as the center. From this position in the center of the universe we are able to exist in a place removed from mundane context. Because [[There is no such thing as time, only context]] -- from this new contextual position we have great power to rewrite our understanding of our place in the universe and reintegrate with a new context

### Ceremony and our relation to culture
- need to orient ourselves to the cultural practice and symbol set- similar to orienting the symbols around us in space?
    - that's why using ancestral or cultural symbols are more powerful
    - memetics?
