AMORC, a sect of [[Rosicrucianism]] and a fraternal order has a book desdcribing an astral meeting place. It is visited through what seems to be a form of [[Astral Travel]]

A spiritual plane- it is a shared plane and all who seek to commune with the spirit are present here. To ascend:

-   wash hands to symbolize purity of the body
-   drink water to represent a desire to be pure internally
-   recite the following:

> May the Sublime Essence of the Cosmic infuse my being and cleanse me of all impurities of mind and body, that I may enter the Celestial Sanctum and attune in all purity and perfect dignity. So Mote It Be!

-   then rise above the earth
-   enter the holy place and envision the beauty and feelings of spiritual inspiration
-   then enter into communion with God
