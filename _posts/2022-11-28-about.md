This website is a living public record of my notes and thoughts. While most of my notes live in my personal notion in a rough state- I want to begin synthesizing them into a more atomic form to help with later video production. For this I am following a similar methodology to Andy Matuschak's  [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).  

This website is forked from the [Jekyll Garden theme](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) by Hiran Venugopalan. 

Because this website is using borrowed technology, I may redesign and migrate to another build at some point but I have chosen this solution as it seems the most portable. The obsidian notes with front matter should be easily parsed if I choose to create a custom solution in the future.
