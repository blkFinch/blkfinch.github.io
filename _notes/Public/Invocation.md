Invocation is the act of "calling in" a spirit or deity. This is different than [[Evocation]] which typically involves "summoning" a spirit or entity to appear in an external form to do work or answer questions.

Under some modalities this is another form of servitor creation that creates an aditional "Ego" that attaches to your own
