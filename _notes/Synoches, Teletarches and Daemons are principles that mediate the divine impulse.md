Instead of the four Arch Angels called to in the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] , the forces called to in the [[Star Ruby]] ritual are the *lynges*, a type of spinning disc toy, *Synoches, Teletarches and Daemons* which are principles that mediate the divine impulse in four distinct ways:
- Lynges *Initiate*
- Synoches *Maintain*
- Teletarches *Perfect*
- Daemons *Execute*

These correspondances are initially devised within the [[Chaldean Scheme]] of the universe

>==The Iynges (singular “Iynx”), Synoches, Teletarches and Daemones are divine principles from the Second Order of the emanationist hierarchy of late Neoplatonism==, based on the _Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster_. Their position in the Neoplatonist hierarchy is intermediate between the “intelligible” world, or world of ideation, and the “sensible” world, or world of perception. ==Their functions are, respectively, as “initiators,” “maintainers,” “perfectors,” and “executors” of the Divine Creative Impulse== which originates in the intelligible world and ultimately manifests in the sensible world. Further information on them may be found in the published editions of the _Chaldean Oracles_ edited by W. Wynn Westcott and G.R.S. Mead, and in the works of Proclus, Damascius, Michael Psellus, George Gemistos Plethon, and other late Neoplatonist philosophers.
