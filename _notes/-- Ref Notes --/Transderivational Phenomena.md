The unconscious mind can extract information from language through a derivational process. This allows us to extract more meaning from language then is actually signified by the language.

For example: *The broken window*
Conveys not only that there is a window, and it is broken; but also implies the act of breaking which occured in the past, and had a culprite (who broke it? when?).

By using allegory without directly mentioning the client we can subvert the conscious mind and allow the unconscious mind to extract relevant meaning.

*People can find it easy to learn* => Implies people, and the unconscious mind can then make the connection- "I am a person, I can find it easy to learn" without the hypnotist having to directly speak to the conscious mind.
