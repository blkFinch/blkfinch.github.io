My working theory is that there is a fundamental pattern to most magical practices. We can look to successful operations and they should mostly contain or be part of the following sequence

- purify 
- destroy blockage
- set intent
- enter hyper reality (or altered reality) [[The Magic Circle]]
- Actively choose intent
- Leave hyper reality (sealing)


Almost all magical and mystical practices begin with a [[Banishing]] of some sort, or a purification process.
