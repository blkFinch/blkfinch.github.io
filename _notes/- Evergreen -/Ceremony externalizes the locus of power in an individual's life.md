There is an instinct in modern magical circles to try and understand all magical experiences as functions of our internal psychology. For example, some magicians like to think of the various spirits that can be evoked as some representation of a subconscious part of the magicians mind.

Ceremony, through its ritual actions, externalizes the spiritual experience and reframes it as existing outside the individual. The individual can perform actions to call in forces much bigger than themself. __The spiritual forces thus shift from being interior, individual pathologies, and become ecological and collective.__

Ceremony asks us not to turn inward, but to turn outwards. Not only does[[Ceremony centers us within the material and temporal universe]], but we are also placed __within__ that universe.
