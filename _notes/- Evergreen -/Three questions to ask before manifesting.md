Based on the idea that [[There are three fundamental steps in making a true decision]] and that all it takes to truly have something is the decision to have it
(see: Transurfing, [[The Master Key System|The Master Key]]) - There must be a clear vision of the goal (the creative mind develops the vision), the honest belief that is possible (the intellectual mind acts as a defense and it must be aligned), the willingness to have it NOW 

- *"What do I want?"* - vision
- *"Do I believe it is Possible for me To have this?"* - belief / intellectual
- *"Am I ready to have this now?"* - Will
	- It is important that we put no modifiers on this. If we want this reality tomorrow, or after something else, then we are not being honest with What we want
