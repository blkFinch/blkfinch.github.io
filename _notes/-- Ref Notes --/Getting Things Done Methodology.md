#### 1. Capture
- everything from brain goes into inbox
- have as few inboxes as possible to reduce places to look 
- as new thoughts, tasks, and other clutter comes up- add it to inbox

If just starting out review the [Trigger List](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf) to empty brain of all loose clutter


#### 2. Clarify
- If it will take < 2 minutes just do it
- If it can be delegated -> Delegate it
- If it's non-actionable file it in correct place or delete it
- If it needs to be done at a specific time- give it a due date
- If its no longer actionable -> delete
- If it requires more than one step -> create project -> assign next step to project

#### 3. Organize
- tasks are then organized as one-offs, repeating, agenda items to discuss with people, etc..
- each of these should live in an easy to access place
- tasks can be sorted with _contexts_ which signify where they can be done

The organizing and clarifying process happen together. Organizing should fit your personal needs.

#### 4. Engage
- Do the tasks using the systems in place
- Check contexts - when on the computer open the _#computer_ context, for home work check _#home_
- 

#### Review Weekly
To align on goals and projects, clear out stale tasks etc
