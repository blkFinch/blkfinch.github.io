Intuitively, within the human experience it is easy to think of myself as existing within a flow of time- grasping at experiences as they pass.

Instead let us imagine that we are simply a page of a flip book. When it is  in motion it appears as if a single character (ego) is animated through a continuity- but actually each page is its own unique drawing that is completely disjoint from the other pages. The other pages give it context however.

Changing our future or past is much easier than shifting future or past positions- we only need to take our selves and place it within a new context
