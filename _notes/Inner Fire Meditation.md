### Preperation
- Dissolve into nothingness and visualize yourself as the godform of Heruka
- Visualize the Guru, he enters your body and energizes your Heart, Throat and Head chakras
- Clear the crown chakra with white light
- Throat is cleared with Red light, the throat and crown communicate with each other
- Heart is charged with blue light
- red pyramid with _a_ stroke at navel chakra

### Igniting the Fire
- Vase meditation
- Breathe in- feel prana enter the navel chakra from _ida_ and _pingala_. Swallow, and press air down, while pulling lower air up to meet in the navel chakra
- hold breath as long as is comfortable
- expell breath through central channel 
- With each breath the _a_ becomes hotter like a coal until it bursts into flame

__When breathing like this- feel emotional, self pity energy clear from side channels and is burned in the navel__

Continue this breathing without forcing. Allow heat to build naturally. Red light radiates outward from the navel chakra, filling the body with bliss.

_The heat at this point should be subtle and deep. Feeling heat on the skin or beginning to perspire is a sign you are pushing too hard_

### Blazing the Inner Fire
- the A becomes super hot and bursts into flames
- The fire enters the central channel
- The heat from each breath vibrates each of the upper chakras

### Blazing and Dripping
- The upper chakras, one at a time begin to melt
- The drops from the chakras fall into the fire below causing to blaze even more
- The chakra bursts into flame, in turn melting the one above

### Extraordinary Blazing and Dripping
- Heat enters the lower chakra
- bliss fills entire body
- each upper chakra bursts into flame
- Lighting flashes out the third eye and fills the universe with bliss then reenters you'

>“May all sentient beings discover blissful channels and chakras, and may the blissful winds enter the central channel. May they all discover the great blissful kundalini experience by developing inner fire in the central channel. May all sentient beings thereby achieve the totality of the illusory body and clear light wisdom.”
