In this book, Janes gives instructions on how to manifest an ideal romantic partner. She is working from the _Law of Attraction_ model of manifestation and describes a straightforward step based approach. She includes tips and techniques from her personal experience.

### Notes

#### Believe Your Ideal Relationship is Possible

>Perhaps what society / religion considers an unusual sexual relationship? So what? It will not be unusual to you and your mate, but normal and what you need to be content. In reality, you are not alone in whatever you wish. <mark class="hltr-yellow">There is always someone who is looking for the same thing.</mark>

 No matter how unique or different your relationship preferences are, there are others who are out there who want the same thing as you.

#### Creating and Interacting with A Vision Board
>-Using those pretty marker pens, around or near each picture write a title or description. IE: Across the top of a picture of Jamaica, you write “our winter home.” Near a picture of the person write things like “honest.” “Proud of me.” “Ambitious.” Things like that.

>Change it or add to it almost every day. The more times you touch it and interact with it, the more a reality it becomes for you. Even if you just color in one letter, you are interacting with it and it is a living thing.

Janes suggests using words on the vision board to specify the meaning of each image. Interestingly she also suggests interacting with it. The more we talk to/touch/and interact with the vision board it becomes imbued with life.

This process sounds like creating a servitor, or a spirit. 
#### The Steps for Manifesting a Partner
1) Deal with personal trauma which prevents love from entering into your heart
2) Create Ideal
	1) create list of ideals
	2) order list and prioritize
	3) create vision board from list
	4) Continue to keep the ideal alive in your mind but not obsessive
3) Apply Ideal
	1) make space for them in your life
	2) Don't fall into jealousy

#### Steps for Dating
><mark class="hltr-yellow">First. Don’t attack every person you meet to find out if they’re the one.  Second. Enjoy everyone for exactly who they are.</mark> Do not attach strings to any relationship you have. <mark class="hltr-yellow">Don’t place expectations on folks. Just live in each encounter for what it is and don’t force any emotions that person is not offering you freely</mark> and upfront. Enjoy that two-minute chat over the coffee pot in the lunch room. Don’t expect it to produce anything, just enjoy.  <mark class="hltr-yellow">Third. For every person whose eye catches yours and vice versa, try to interact with that person</mark>. A nod, a word in the grocery store. An offer of giving a hand. It is written by many exerts that every person whose eye catches yours, holds something you need or want. Nevertheless, isn’t it a nice world where we can chat with strangers without strings?

1) Don't start by trying to find out if everyone is "The One"
2) Enjoy everyone for who they are and stay in the moment
3) Every person who catches your eye- make contact however small (this increases opportunity)

#### Making a Hole and Maintaining Connection

>You must make at least a token “hole” for them to fit into your life. Empty one drawer. Clear out ten inches of hanging space. Designate a place at your table and call it “his / her place.” Want an extra-large person in your life? Do you have a big enough chair? Maybe a recliner? Do you sleep in a double bed? Where have you made room for them?

Make space for that person in your life literally and figuratively. Physically making space, like setting a chair for them or emptying a drawer brings the vision into material. You should also talk to your partner as if they are there in your life. This keeps the relationship alive and the connection there.

>First thing in the morning, say good morning. Tell them to have a wonderful day. Again, that person will feel your love.  Throughout the day, you can say to yourself “wait until I tell you this?” Talk to them like they’re standing right there beside you because they are…


#### Jealousy Turns into Knowing

Don't fall into jealousy- instead just know that it is the world showing you what you want. Say
"Mine looks like that" instead

>one day, I looked upon a man and a woman, holding hands and chatting comfortably with each other and I thought “that’s what mine looks like.” Eureka! Everything changed! It wasn’t 2 weeks and I met Rusty.  So, if you want something and you see it in your day to day life, remark to yourself “mine is like that!”

#### A meditation of Gratitude

> Focus on One Thing and Tell Me All the Positives  This is a tool that has helped me tremendously and is one of my main ways to rebuild positive thinking habits. Focus your eyes on the first thing you see in front of you. A vase, a pen, the grass. Begin a review of that item by saying all the things about that item that please you.
