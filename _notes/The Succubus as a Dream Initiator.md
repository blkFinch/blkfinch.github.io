The succubus as a concept has been much reviled. Many even contemporary magicians caution against mixing sexual desire with [[Internal Conscious Being]] work- or any form of [[Evocation]] . However many even non-magicians have had the experience of sexual encounters within the dream state, and [[Nothing is Evil]] -- so we should not shy away from working with these entities. 

Writers like [[Carlos Castenada]] and [[Faustus Crow]] (_both potentially bad men, just to be noted here. Carlos was an abuser of his disciples perhaps leaving a disciple to die in the desert. Crow I am unsure about but his prose includes casual antisemitism_) both note that there exists entities of a feminine nature within the dream state that can act as guides or initiators or literal Gateways into lucid dream states or other [[Planes of Existence]] . It is possible these two see these initiatory entities as female, as a projection of the Anima- and that a more feminine identified person may see these entities as masculine projections of their internal Animus.

The idea is to use the sexual energy aroused by the succubus to lift the conscious to a state of lucidity. Same concept as how we can [[Use Inverted Sexual Impulse to overcome Sleep Paralysis]] .
