[[Aleister Crowley]] and the poet Victor Neuburg engaged in a relationship, ostensibly as mentor and student- with Crowley acting as a magical [[Guru]] for Neuburg. The two of them would together perform several magical workings of import:
- _The Paris Working_ (A [[Sex Magic]] ritual)
- The enochian workings which would become _The Vision and the Voice_

The nature of their relationship seems to have been more than that of a teacher and student as Neuburg would write extensively of Crowley in his book _The Triumph of Pan_ . The two were romantically and sexually involved during the times of these workings.

### BDSM activities

The nature of their relationship seems to be a _power exchange_ relationship that both men entered into willingly. Neurburg swore himself to absolute service of Crowley, and Crowley would delight in causing pain to the (what he perceived as ) masochistic Neuburg.

Some of these escapes include:

- Crowley cucks neuburg with Euphemia 
- making Neuburg starve, and sleep on the floor naked
- flogging him with switches of nettle
- publicly walking Neuburg around on a leash

While many have looked at this relationship as abusive, an example of crowley abusing his power and status as a spiritual guide to Neuburg- I think there is  more going on here.

By Neuburg's own words we can see that he was at times enjoying the work, and the punishment. He does genuinely seem to love Crowley. And the two would split up multiple times before Neuburg had his break down in the 1910's.

While abuse may have existed in their relationship, a good portion of the most deviant acts do seem to be consensual.

>it is possible that Neuburg’s final “Ordeal” as a Probationer included a sacred sexual act with his Guru. But there is certainly an erotic tension that shows through frequently in Neuburg’s written record. <mark class="hltr-pink">Crowley saw Neuburg as a masochist and indulged to the hilt his own sadistic tendencies toward Neuburg</mark>—this was, indeed, a constant not only during this retirement, but throughout the whole of their relationship.

>On occasion, the discipline, or abuse, took on physical form, as when <mark class="hltr-pink">Crowley scourged Neuburg on his naked back and buttocks with a gorse switch or a bundle of nettles</mark>. In an entry from the fifth day, Neuburg lamented that his Guru had upbraided him severely and was “apparently a homosexual Sadist.” In notes appended to this entry a week later, Crowley wryly warned: “Slandering one’s Guru is punished in the thirty-second and last Hell.” To which Neuburg replied: “A small price to pay for the invention of a new vice.”
