While writing my note [[All exists on a spectrum of vibration]] I realize that I don't have a good word to refer to all of everything. *The Universe* typical refers to all of everything within the material plane or the world of elements. *Consciousness* is close and I do believe that there is nothing outside of *Consciouness* so refering to it as a whole does include everything I mean when I say everything.

*However* my concern with using the word *Consciouness* in this way will mislead some people into interpreting me as excluding non-sentient parts of reality (if that exists!).
