The internet now is a sequence of algorithms surfacing content in an attempt to keep our eyes glued to the screen for as long as possible. This means content that maintains certain metrics like "engagement" will be prioritized. Any cursory search for guides on how to produce popular content on contemporary social media sites will give various metrics that different platforms use to prioritize content in their feeds and they are invariably primarily concerned with popularity, engagement, and watch time. 

In my opinion good, interesting art should be slightly agonistic to consume. There should be friction in the consumption of the art. Most works by artists that I really appreciate these days, require attention, and are often uncomfortable or thought provoking in a way that may turn away less invested viewers.

This means that content or art that is challenging in any way will become buried by empty content produced in a calculated way to maximize the algorithm. This is content that has been tuned to be easy to digest, flashy and eye catching to keep watch time up, and slightly annoying enough to cause people to engage with it.
