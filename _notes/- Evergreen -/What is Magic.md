__Magic is a word which describes any process through which a non material form is made manifest into material reality__

#todo _my thoughts on this have changed, I now believe magic to be a living art just like dance or painting or any other mundane art. It implements common techniques ([[A taxonomy of Magical Techniques|Magical Technique]]) to achieve various goals both practical and aesthetic. Its modern practitioners push the art forward and are in conversation with the practitioners of the past see [[Magic as an Academic Field]]_

My personal theory currently is [[Magic is the art of making a true Decision]]

Many magicians have answered in different ways but we can see certain patterns emerge:
- [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will]]
- Spare, [[Magic is but one's natural ability to attract without asking]]

We can see that magic involves some sort of change to the external environment. And that [[Magic is an expression of the will]] .

Magic, intuitively stands against secular culture, but on closer inspection we may find that there is little within magical practice that is inherently superstitious or uninformed. In fact, we see many originally "occult" principals on full display within secular society but they have been sanitized of cultural understanding and rebranded to be instrumentalized by capitalism and [[The Cult of Productivity]]

If we can narrow in on what the Goal of magic is- then we can perhaps answer the question [[Is there a fundamental Magical Process]] ? I suspect there is. While the aesthetics of magic may change I do believe there is an underlying phsycho-physiological process that occurs during successful ritual.
