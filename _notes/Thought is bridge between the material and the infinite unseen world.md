We use thought to explore, manifest and create.

>14. Thought is the invisible link by which the individual comes
into communication with the Universal, the finite with the
Infinite, the seen with the Unseen. Thought is the magic by
which the human being is transformed into a being who
thinks and knows and feels and acts

There exists the world of material [[The Material Plane]] and the spiritual/magical and unseen world. All form exists outside of the material world and the tool that humans have to pull those forms into the material world and manifest them into reality is thought.
