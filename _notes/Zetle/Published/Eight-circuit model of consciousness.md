Model of understanding various "experiences of consciousness" . First proposed by Tim Leary and then refined by Robert Anton Wilson.

## Terrestial Circuits

### First Circuit
*Vegetative-Invertabrate / Oral Bio-Survival*

This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival,Â suckling, cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.

Imprinted in early infancy- leads to a default life position of feeling "okay" or "not okay". A negative experience during this phase could lead to a deep sensation of the environment generally being hostile. 

### Second Circuit
*Emotional-Locomotion Circuit/ Anal-Territorial* 

Domination/submission and territory.

Imprinted in  toddler phase. Positive experiences here lead to a "Dominant" attitude versus a "submissive" attitude. 

### The imprinting of the first 2 circuits leads to a particular elemental disposition
The previous two circuits can only imprint in a binary manner: *Trust/Suspiscion* for the first, and *Dominance/Submission* for the second. This means that there are four possible combinations of base imprints. These can then be mapped to [[The Four Primary Elements]] 
- Trust/Dominance: Fire (friendly strength)
- Trust/Submission: Water (Friendly Weakness)
- Suspiscion/Dominance: Air (Unfriendly Strength)
- Suspiscion/Submission: Earth (Unfriendly Weakness)

### Third Circuit
*Laryngeal-Manual Symbolic/ Semantic Time-Binding* 

Symbols, language, logic. This circuit is the minds ability to abstract the world into a symbol. Some animals like crows show this ability as well- to be able to look at a problem and imagine solutions then apply the solution to the real scenario.

### Fourth Circuit
*Socio-Sexual Domestication*

Connected with our first *orgasm* experience. Is concerned with social conections, tribe and family. reproduction. Cultural Values

## Post Terrestial 

### Fifth Circuit
*Neurosomatic Circuit*

When activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well being arises. This is a sort of elevated circuit from the physical needs of the body while still being fully aware of it. While the first circuit regards a sensation of physical wellbeing this circuit regards a sensation of *metaphysical* wellbeing.


### Sixth Circuit
*Neuo-Electric/ Metaprogramming*

This circuit is aware of itself and is capable of reprogramming the previous circuits. This allows us to perform self-initiation. 

### Seventh Circuit
*Neurogenetic/ Morphogenetic*

This is our connection to our evolutionary history- and in fact the genetic history of all life. This circuit seems to be the gateway to the Aativan consciouness described by [[Austin Osman Spare]] where in he sinks into the evolutionary consciouness of our ancestors.

### Eighth Circuit
*Neuro-Atomic Metaphysiology / Non-Local Quantum*

Non-local awareness and enlightenment.
