> Traditionally, there are three types of karma.
First, there is sanchita karma. This is the col-
lected karma from all of your past lifetimes.
Some people consider parabdha karma-that
portion of sanchita karma you are working on
in this lifetime-to be a fourth type of karma
but I consider it an aspect of sanchita karma
The second type is called agami karma. This
is the karma you have created in your current
life. It differs from parabdha karma in that you
are not working on it (that is, trying to work it
off), you are just acquiring it. 'The third type is
called kriyamana karma. It is the karma you cre-
ate and work off immediately, popularly known
as "instant karma" For example, park your car
illegally and you get a ticket.
