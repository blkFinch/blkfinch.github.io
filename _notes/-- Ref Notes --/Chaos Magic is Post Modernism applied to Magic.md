_note 12/8/23 : I believe when I noted this I misunderstood post modernism. I now believe modernism to be a much more accurate descriptor for what happened with magic during the rise of Chaos Magic. Modernism seeks to streamline and we see that process happening to magic during this period. see [[Chaos Magick is Modernism applied to Magic]] . I am leaving this note here for ref_

In some sense we can look at the Chaos Magic movement as being perfectly in step with post modern sensibilities of the time. Chaos Magic existed in opposition to the old, "stodgy", systems of magic that seemed to be so reliant on tradition and formal [[Rituals|ritual]]. 
Chaos Magic opposes these old structures of magical thought by saying-

_"The symbol is not what matters but rather our relationship to it"_

This, at the time, seemed to be a huge deconstruction of Magic as it was practiced- which previously relied heavily on an aspirants ability to study and learn whichever particular symbol set was associated with the system.

### Meta Modern Magic?
Since we can see that magical philosophy is just as susceptible to aesthetic ideologies as any other art form- it should stand to reason that there is now existing a magical perspective that falls more in line with the "meta modern"  ideology which is still being defined but seems to indicate a return to sincerity but with out being trapped by tradition .
