According to [[Liber Astarte]] a proper invocation should have 7 parts

- An Imprecation // said in Awe
	- like slave to lord
- An oath // fealty
	- like vassal to liege
- A memorial // dependence
	- like child to parent
- An prayer // adoration
	- like priest to god
- A colloquy (discussion) // confidence
	- like brother to brother
- A conjuration // comradeship
	- friend to friend
- A madrigal (a song) // passion
	- lover to mistress

This form moves the magician from a position well below to one of union with the deity. Starting as a lowly servant and becoming a lover to the deity.

>First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord.  
  Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.  
  Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.  
  Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.  
  Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.  
  Sixth, a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend.  
  Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.

  And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty, the third of dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of confidence, the sixth of comradeship, the seventh of passion.
