An [[Ego]] is a collection of desires and beliefs. It is developed so often through rejection of the "not self". Our early growth is marked by learning what is "not self"- when we first experience the absence of the mother as a baby we learn that we can experience lack and thus are somehow not the mother.

This discovery of "Not self" continues through life as we calcify into a shell of what we believe we are. This protects us from disappointment and pain by extracting painful experiences into being caused by "not self" actors or outside forces.

These beliefs become limiting though because ultimately they determine our activity.

And the more we believe we know what we are- the more opportunities life can present to prove us wrong.

*It is ideal to not hold tightly to the illusion of ego. The less we believe about ourselves the more becomes possible in this world*  see the 2nd step in [[There are three fundamental steps in making a true decision]]

> Developing an ego is like building a castle against reality. It provides some defense and a sense of purpose, but the larger it is, the more it invites attack, and eventually it must crumble. There is a further problem. All fortresses are also prisons. Because our beliefs imply a rejection of their opposites, they severely restrict our freedom
