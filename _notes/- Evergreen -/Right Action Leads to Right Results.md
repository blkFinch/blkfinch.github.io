If trying to reach a result, we do not need to have a map of the entire route we will take. Maintaining a clear goal is enough. We can then align each action we take by the single question:
_Does this action move me closer to my desired result?_ 

If we can answer yes to that question for every action we take then we can be assured we will eventually reach the goal.

This is important to remember when trying to quantify progress, as everyone's journey to the same destination will be different. We can only really judge our progress by interrogating each action and determining if we are actively moving in the correct direction.
