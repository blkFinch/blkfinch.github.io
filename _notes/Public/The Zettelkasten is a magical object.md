[[The Slipbox note taking method]], or Zettelkasten method, is designed to create a sort of automated conversation partner. Luhman was very explicit in this use of the slip box as a sort of automated conversation partner. He even refers to his slip box as a person in his essay, *Communicating With Slip Boxes*, and later describes how the process of creating a zettlekasten allows a "living" ego to emerge from the notes.

> <span class='hltxt'>As a result of extensive work with this technique a kind of secondary memory will arise, an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate.</span> It proves to be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no linear structure like a book.<span class='hltxt'> Just because of this, it gets its own life, independent of its author.</span>

This emergence of a seperate consciousness is similar in nature to Golems, Tulpas, or Servitors. Functiontionally we are [[creating a golem]] but instead of using blood and clay as the medium for this new life, we are using our own knowledge- externalized and made living by threading the pieces together.

> **The main interaction with the slip-box is not when we are writing and adding new notes, because the slip-box is not there to be an archive of our memory and knowledge. Slip-box is there to be an apparatus with which we think. Therefore, the main interaction is when we communicate with the slip-box by confronting ourselves and our thinking with our prior knowledge.**
