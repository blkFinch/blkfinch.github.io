The Sephira of the tree of life can be used to describe various functions and aspects of the soul. For example, [[Hod]] is often associated with the mind's ability to perform logic and problem solve, while [[Netzach]] is associated with the emotional body. These spheres are not meant to be singular agents, instead they are meant to function together- 

==in fact spiritual development depends on clearing blockage and improving communication across all these spheres==
#todo make a seperate note? ^

The [[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]] can be mapped  onto the Sephira as shown in the [[Bluefluke, Psychonaut Field Manual]]
