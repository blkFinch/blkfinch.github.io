__Best way to learn to nap is to adapt to non-reducing Biphasic schedule__. It will take longer but will allow me to learn napping with out forced sleep deprivation

__A faster way to learn : Pick a schedule with 3 naps__ 

first wake up early, then give into sleepiness after lunch

- avoid screens for at least 15 minutes before nap time
- Give 5-10 minutes extra on each nap to cool down before sleeping
- nap at same time every day
- _try progressive muscle relaxation__
- while laying down, focus on  lowering heart rate. _count for 60 beats then listen for 60 beats_
- once heart rate is slowed, then clear mind
- set an alarm and dont snooze
