[[Action is preceded by desire]] Before we *do* anything there is the *urge* to do ( *the idea of reflexive action seems to exist contra to this - explore more* ) . 

This is based in the idea that imagination, thought and creativity, precede action.  When arguing that [[Life imitates art]], Oscar Wilde uses this idea to claim that the creative idea is first expressed in art before it is manifested in action in life.

*If all desire manifests in eventual action, then desires could unintentionally conflict with each other and cause conflicting actions which prevent fulfillment of either desire* 

Consider the following example:

**I desire to be a famous actor. I also have anxiety about auditioning so I desire to not be judged.** 

These two desires conflict with each other and there is very few ways for them both to become manifest in reality. What is likely to happen is one desire will thwart the other and neither will come to fruition.

This is why [[Aleister Crowley]] claimed [[Lesser wills and desires must be organized under a single aspiration to attain]] 

Because of this, [[Desires can be fed to other desires]], and we can sacrifice one desire to another to bring the later to fruition
