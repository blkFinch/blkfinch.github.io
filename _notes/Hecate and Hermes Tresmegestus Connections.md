Hecate is an ancient Goddess typically associated with Sirius, the moon, magic, keys and doors, and roads- particularly three way cross roads. 

In the myth of Dimitir and Persephone, Hecate acts as a guide and initiator for the two. In the Elusian Mysteries Hecate also takes on the symbolic role of initiator. This role is also depicted on the the [[Tarot]] trump card, The Hierophant. On this card is depected [[Hermes Trismegistus]] the creator of [[Hermeticism]] 

Hecate is often associated with [[The Triad]] , depected as having three bodies and sometimes referred to as *Hecate Trimorphis* . This is reminiscent of Hermes *Thrice Great* 

- What do both these figures have to do the trinity?
- are they connected in other ways?

Hecate is associated with the Moon and Yesod but Hermes is associated with Hod and Mercury. so they are not in complete parity with one an other.
