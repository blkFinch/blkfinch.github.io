story of girl becoming mesmerized by hypersigil

> Here the imitation, as far as it went, was of course accidental.  
> In the following case the imitation was self-conscious. In the  
> year 1879, just after I had left Oxford, I met at a reception at  
> the house of one of the Foreign Ministers a woman of very curious  
> exotic beauty. We became great friends, and were constantly  
> together. And yet what interested me most in her was not her  
> beauty, but her character, her entire vagueness of character. She  
> seemed to have no personality at all, but simply the possibility of  
> many types. Sometimes she would give herself up entirely to art,  
> turn her drawing-room into a studio, and spend two or three days a  
> week at picture galleries or museums. Then she would take to  
> attending race-meetings, wear the most horsey clothes, and talk  
> about nothing but betting. She abandoned religion for mesmerism,  
> mesmerism for politics, and politics for the melodramatic  
> excitements of philanthropy. In fact, she was a kind of Proteus,  
> and as much a failure in all her transformations as was that  
> wondrous sea-god when Odysseus laid hold of him. One day a serial  
> began in one of the French magazines. At that time I used to read  
> serial stories, and I well remember the shock of surprise I felt  
> when I came to the description of the heroine. She was so like my  
> friend that I brought her the magazine, and she recognised herself  
> in it immediately, and seemed fascinated by the resemblance. I  
> should tell you, by the way, that the story was translated from  
> some dead Russian writer, so that the author had not taken his type  
> from my friend. Well, to put the matter briefly, some months  
> afterwards I was in Venice, and finding the magazine in the  
> reading-room of the hotel, I took it up casually to see what had  
> become of the heroine. It was a most piteous tale, as the girl had  
> ended by running away with a man absolutely inferior to her, not  
> merely in social station, but in character and intellect also. I  
> wrote to my friend that evening about my views on John Bellini, and  
> the admirable ices at Florian's, and the artistic value of  
> gondolas, but added a postscript to the effect that her double in  
> the story had behaved in a very silly manner. I don't know why I  
> added that, but I remember I had a sort of dread over me that she  
> might do the same thing. Before my letter had reached her, she had  
> run away with a man who deserted her in six months. I saw her in  
> 1884 in Paris, where she was living with her mother, and I asked  
> her whether the story had had anything to do with her action. She  
> told me that she had felt an absolutely irresistible impulse to  
> follow the heroine step by step in her strange and fatal progress,  
> and that it was with a feeling of real terror that she had looked  
> forward to the last few chapters of the story. When they appeared,  
> it seemed to her that she was compelled to reproduce them in life,  
> and she did so. It was a most clear example of this imitative  
> instinct of which I was speaking, and an extremely tragic one.
