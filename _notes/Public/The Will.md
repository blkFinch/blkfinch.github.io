The divine impulse inside. __The Will is the our impulse to action that is not in response to external influence__

## The True Will
The true will, represented by the [[Holy Guardian Angel]] is the deepest impulse, unaffected by non-divinity. The true will of the individual is one which fits within all others. All strife in the world is caused by actors not in accord with their true will

_If everyone were to fully follow their true will all conscious beings would have the most successful life experience_
