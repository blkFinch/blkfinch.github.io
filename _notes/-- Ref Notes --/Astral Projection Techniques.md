Techniques to induce Astral as well as etheric projection

## Preliminary

Sit in front of mirror. Close eyes and imagine body. Persist until easy to imagine full body

Then move consciousness to the reflected image. Attempt to see other parts of the room from the reflections perspective.

Once successful move on

## Technique A

1.  Sit in position that is relaxing but not conducive to sleep
2.  In spirit vision perform the - imagine yourself robed and holding dagger
3.  perform middle pillar
4.  visualize vayu in throat
5.  vibrate god name YHVH Elohim
6.  Focus on nape of neck- top vertabrae (ignore initial signs like vibrations, tightness in throat, tilting — instead continue focusing on throat)
7.  allow projection to occur

CONTINUE FOR 4 WEEKS DAILY — best if same time and place

> If this practice is kept up regularly with concentrated effort for three to four weeks, preferably at the same time each day, then success is fairly certain. However once the first projection occurs it is imperative to re-double your efforts to ensure that this ability becomes one that can be used at will, rather than a 'one-off' success.

## Technique B

Create a mental path to travel that leads up a mountain. Imagine yourself walking this path. At the top of the mountain are two pillars one white and one black with a veil between them. Sit in front of the veil and imagine another you on the other side. Shift consciousness to the other you.

## Technique C
*Technique for etheric projection*
Project in any manner.

-   face the body
-   Observe the body breathing
-   imagine a link between your solar plexus and the solar plexus of the astral body
-   pull etheric matter into your astral body
-   when done- return etheric matter to body
