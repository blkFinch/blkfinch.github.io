Mastering truth gives the aspirant the power of speaking into existence new truth

> *36. By the establishment of truthfulness the Yogi gets the power of attaining for himself and others the fruits of work without the works.*
>
>When this power of truth will be established with you, then even in dream you will never tell an untruth, in thought, word or deed; whatever you say will be truth. You may say to a man " Be blessed," and that man will be blessed. If a man is diseased, and you say to him, " Be thou cured," he will be cured immediately.

### Pranayama
first practice is just measured breathing and connecting with a sacred word or symbol.

>The first lesson is just to breathe in a measured way, in and out. That will harmonize the system. When you have practiced this for some time, you will do well to join to it the repetition of some word as "Om," or any other sacred word. In India we use certain symbolical words instead of counting one, two, three, and four. That is why I advise you to join the mental repetition of the "Om," or some other sacred word to the Pranayama.

The second practice involves breathing in through one nostril, out through the other, then in through that nostril and out through the first. Vivekananda recommends starting with a ratio of 4:16:8 for breathing in, holding, and breathing out. He also suggests starting with *four rounds* and increasing slowly over time.
>Draw in four seconds, hold in sixteen seconds, then throw out in eight seconds. This makes one Pranayama.
