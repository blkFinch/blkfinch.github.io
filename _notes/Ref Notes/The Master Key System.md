Haanel, Charles F. _The Maseter Key System_. St. Martinâ€™s Essentials, 2023.
## Overview
The Master Key System is a work of New Thought literature that is heavily influenced by the concept of the Law of Attraction

## Notes
### The Objective mind Judges and the Subjective mind Responds

__The subconscious mind can change material conditions__

The objective mind connects us to the external world and the subconscious mind connects us to the internal world
The conditions in the internal world affect the conditions in the outer world

>Someone may ask: "How can the subconscious change conditions?" The reply is, because the subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference is one of degree. The whole, as we know, is creative; in fact, it is the only creator there is; consequently we find that mind is creative, and as thought is the only activity which the mind possesses thought must necessarily be creative also

The Subconscious mind is actually connected to the greater consciousness. This is what allows subconscious activity to affect external conditions- the subjective mind is indeed directly connected with all other subjective minds.

>It is through the subconscious that we are connected with the universal mind and brought into relation with the infinite constructive forces of the universe.

The conscious mind perceives the conditions in the outer world, uses reasoning and discrimination to craft a narrative that is communicated to the subconscious mind which then goes about reinforcing those conditions


### Part 4
About the ego. The trues self is not the mind or body. The true self controls the mind and body. The personality is a collection of traits and habits but is not the true self (ego). 
_This book uses ego to refer to the true self_

- Selfish thought is the core of failure. All transactions must benefit all parties. __this is because the indivdual is part of the universal... and one part can not truly antagonize another part.__ _pg 71_
- _I can be what I will to be_ (powerful affirmation)
- Gaining absolute control of the self unlocks the reflection of our decisions in the outside world.

_the universe can not express itself through you if you are busy with your own plans- still the mind and concentrate upon the source within_
- visualize the events which could transpire to bring you into greater purpose
- The grander the vision you can imagine the more the universe will use you

seek silence:
> power comes through repose, it is in the Silence that we can be still, and when we are still we can think, and thought is the secret of all attainment.

### The subconscious Mind Reacts to the Conscious mind
> Just as the least pressure of the atmosphere causes an action on the part of the weather-vane, so does the least thought entertained by the conscious mind produce within your subconscious mind action in exact proportion to the depth and feeling characterizing the thought and the intensity with which the thought is indulged

The subconscious mind will take action on thoughts proportionate to the intensity of the thought. Deep emotion, and consistent rumination on the thought will increase the action taken (and the result will manifest) - not thinking with any emotion or rumination on an idea will starve it.

### Everyman is the reflection of his thoughts
> Every man is a reflection of the thoughts he has entertained in his life

### Every Effect has a cause
Every Effect has a cause.

Tracing back the cause of each effect will eventually lead us to its creative origin

[[Aleister Crowley]] suggests a similar exercise in Liber 4 regarding finding virgin wood for making a wand -- [[Crowley, Book Four]]

### The Tasks of the Conscious Mind
The objective mind has several responsibilities
- Discrimination
- Process sensory input
- Reasoning
- Seat of the will
- It can direct the subjective mind

_Master key, pg 52_ 

### Summary

- All material is preceded by the creative consciousness (desire precedes action)
- All conscious beings are part of the Universal Mind which creates all things
- Because of this we all have access to this Universal Mind
- The subconscious mind regulates our actions which then lead to material results
- The conscious mind can perceive the world and then makes judgements which are given to the subconscious mind to act upon
- The subconscious mind acts unquestioningly on the judgement given to it by the conscious mind
- Strict control of our conscious mind then allows us to have better control of the actions of the subconscious mind

### The Mind and The Negative Mind

All the cells in the body seem to work together as one organism but they are distinct entities. The yoke that guides all these cells is the _negative mind_ .

> the power of the individual to think makes him positive, so that he can control this negative mind. This is the scientific explanation for metaphysical healing

The conscious mind is the positive mind and controls the negative mind which is ruled by the subconscious.

This reminds me of the endocrine and spinal nervous systems.

As well as _The Animate and The Inanimate_

Thinking correctly requires discipline.

We need to not entertain fears or negative thoughts. We need to actively choose positive thoughts.

The conscious mind becomes the _Guardian of The Gate_ of the subconscious mind.

_Could this be a reference to the guardian of the threshold?_

# chapter 15



#### We must let go of what we have to get something new. We must learn to extract only what we need from what we have.

> We cannot obtain what we lack if we tenaciously cling to what we have. We are able to consciously control our conditions as we come to sense the purpose of what we attract, and we are able to extract from each experience only what we require for further growth.


*6.* As we reach higher planes, we are better able to know what is coming. Similar to knowledge and conversation.


#### all things are for our benefit
All difficulties will continue until we have absorbed what we need from them. Ask *What do I need from this situation?*

#### love under will

> 10. In order to possess vitality thought must be impregnated with love. Love is a product of emotions. It is therefore essential that the emotions be controlled and guided by the intellect and reason.

Love controlled by intellect and reason sounds similar to the idea of love under will

### speech and words
#### _pg. 182, no. 12_ 
[[The First Manifestation of Thought is Language]]

##### pg 183
Humankind has the unique ability to shape thoughts into form through words

Thoughts become words and sentences are collections of thoughts. It is vital to be accurate in speech because this is the way we architect our lives

The power of a hypersigil is in the way it helps us organize thoughts into a clear design for our lives
