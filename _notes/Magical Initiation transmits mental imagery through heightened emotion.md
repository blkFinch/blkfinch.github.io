In the western occult tradition, the primary mode of teaching is through ceremonial initiation. This would typically involve the initiate being taken through a ceremony they have never seen, wherein other adepts perform symbolic acts to them. Then, the hierophant or guide will explain the "occult" or secret meaning of the ceremony so that the initiate may then carry that wisdom with themselves. Hopefully then the now initiated adept will take part in the ceremony for the next aspirant.

These symbols and their "initiated" meanings become fixed in the adepts imagination. Rather than simply being told the meanings- the ceremonial "play" (which will often times be designed to invoke strong emotions of desire or fear) will connect the symbols with a visceral emotion so that when the initiate wishes to use the symbols in their own ritual- the meaning will evoke a full body understanding of the meaning.

This is a benefit of initiation that is hard to capture in solo practice.
