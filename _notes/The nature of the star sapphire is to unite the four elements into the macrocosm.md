If the nature of the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] is to set the four elements in their place

The nature of the SS is to unify the four elements into one substance

> Omnia in Duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quatuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt

is a statement that unifies the infinite in the dyad, the dyad into One, and that one being the nature of the all. So the Four elements are not four or none or two or one.

They are in fact all and can be divided into any combination of these forms.
