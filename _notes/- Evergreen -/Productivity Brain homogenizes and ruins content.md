A consequence of [[The Cult of Productivity]] and the related brain rot I will call _Productivity Brain_[^1] is that all content created by these Productivity Maximizers begins to take a similar shape. You see these types of creations on Youtube frequently. They have a well produced sheen and follow a very rote sequence of beats, crafted from a standard youtube video formula supposedly tuned to the algorithm. There will invariable be some quote pulled by one of the 10 authors anyone of these productivity people read, lots of purchased prefab after-effect motion graphics, some inspiring royalty-free music, and then a regurgitation of some idea or concept that is "on trend".

This sort of content is most frequently produced on topics related to productivity because the sorts of people who make this sort of thing lack any creativity, but content creators of all sorts produce vapid, empty, but optimized content like this all the time.

It buries useful or interesting or challenging content- [[The Algorithm will destroy good content]]
