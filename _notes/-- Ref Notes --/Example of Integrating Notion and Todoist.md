Todoist should be clean and only show actual _next actions_ . Inbox can act as inbox but tasks should be offloaded and organized into notion if they are not due by an explicit date/a must do ([[Getting Things Done Methodology|GTD]])

><mark class="hltr-pink"> I have several tasks planned out in my Notion projects pages.</mark> Then, when Iâ€™m planning my week or a day, I'll put one of those tasks into Todoist with a date I want to work on it. Many times though,<mark class="hltr-pink"> my Todoist task just says "Work on project XYZ." I open up my Notion project page and get to work</mark>
> I like the simplicity of Todoist and <mark class="hltr-pink">I like having a separate app that shows me just the next things I need to work on for the week and for today.</mark>
