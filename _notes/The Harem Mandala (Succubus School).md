[[Faustus Crow]] writes at length about a sort of hypersigil / meditative mandala he uses which he has modeled after an all girls magic school and hogwarts. He has mapped the various parts of the [[Kabbalah]] (using the tree of life) onto this mandala and can use this space to interact with various Goetic demons and other entities as if they are students in the school.

Crow uses the School as a symbol for this map because it contains within it deep archetypal symbols- like hierarchy and focused seperations of subjects. Also most of us have spent large chunks of our formative years in schools so the function and symbology are familliar to us.

The Planetary Spheres  / [[Sephirot]] are connected by the Pathways are represented by "classes" in his magical school. *These classes can be taught by Mistresses who represent each of the keys of the tarot*

The school has 4 houses (each corresponding to  [[The Four Primary Elements]])

__Any entity that can be mapped onto the Tree of Life can then be evoked as a succubus from the Harem Mandala and will visit the practitioner in a dream__ 

Using [[Shamanic Dreaming]] techniques during these visitations will allow the practitioner mastery over the related properties. 

## Creating the Mandala

Using this example we can construct our own harem mandala and use our sex energy to unite with various entities in congress. This sexual union becomes the doorway to the realm with which we are trying to evoke. We can create the mandala in the same way we create our mental palace and the temple.
