by [[Austin Osman Spare]]
_pub 1913_

This book deals deeply with desire and belief. Spare suggests many practices but his fundamental theories are based around some core ideas:

- What is desired will come to be if it is believed
- When beliefs are destroyed they release intense energy that can be used to manifest other desires
- this same energy is released by the destruction of the concept of opposites
- Desires can be redericted ( [[Desires can be fed to other desires]] [[Semen retention]])

>Sigils are the art of believing...
