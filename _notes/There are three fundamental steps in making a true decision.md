To make an honest and true *decision* we must perform 3 steps:

*see also: [[Three Steps to Become Someone]]*
_the first step in this process should be surrender_

## 1: We Desire Change

Any decision must be preceded by a desire to change the current circumstances. This seems intuitive but as humans we often have the habit of wanting to make a decision without actually experiencing change. This is often times not obvious to us as it could be a deeply rooted fear or false belief that keeps us wanting to remain the same.

This tendency is why we often make empty promises to ourselves- *"deciding"* this is the year we go to the gym and then within a month we have stopped altogether. There is an underlying lack of desire *to be a person going to the gym*. In this example we have made a decision without an aligned desire and so no true change will occur as [[Action is preceded by desire]]. 

## 2: We Believe The Result is Possible

Many magical scholars have already pointed out that [[For magic to work the result must be possible]]. But I will put forward the idea that not only that- *we must believe it is possible* . There are many things we are capable of doing that we prevent ourselves from experiencing simply because we lack belief in ourselves or our ability to experience it.

I would argue too that because of the law of correspondence ( [[The Seven Hermetic Principles]] ) it is true also that what is truly possible within mundane reality is also a result of underlying belief structures

## 3: We Make The Choice through Action

Once we have established the previous two truths we are ready to make the decision. This decision is not a passive choice wherein we await the results expectantly- this is an act that we participate in. This is important because this is the expression of [[The Will]] .

Magic now offers us ritual. This action of choice can be symbolized by a ritual we participate in. This symbolic action is what communicates to our subconscious that the decision has been made- and the new pattern of thought has begun.
