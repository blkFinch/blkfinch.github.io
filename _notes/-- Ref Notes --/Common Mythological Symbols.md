There are often common symbols, or even stories in myth which seem to occur across cultures, and around the world. This list is not meant to be exhaustive- it is simply reoccurring themes and symbols that I find personally relevant. 

[[The Sleeping Tree]] for example, reminds me of the experience I had of being a large "Dharma Tree". A tree with all my lives growing like branches simultaneously.
