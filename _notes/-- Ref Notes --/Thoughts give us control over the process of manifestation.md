From the undifferentiated field of possibility ( [[Kether]] ) There is the divine spark of [[The Will]] - [[Action is preceded by desire]] ( represented by [[Chokmah]]) - this spark of desire is given form through mental imagery [[Binah]] it can then be acted upon and manifested. [[There are three steps to every act of will]] :
- Idealization
- Visualization
- Materialization

thoughts produce mental images which create an impression in our subconscious mind which acts upon the universal mind . Therefore control of thought and development of imagination give us control over the world around us.
