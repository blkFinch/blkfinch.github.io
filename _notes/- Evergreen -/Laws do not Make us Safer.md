There's this idea that capitalism and laws to protect capital and property keep us safer. A fear that if we had no law then the strongest people would simply take from the weak whatever they wanted.
But we already live in that world- except strength is measured in money. Do we not live in a world where those with the most capital can simply take and destroy whatever they want and leave the rest of humanity to deal with it. Do the police and the systems of power actually protect people from violence or do they simply maintain the position of power in the hands of those who already have it?

If your employer continues to adjust your logged hours so that he does not need to pay you overtime and you called the police on him for stealing from you- would he go to jail? Would he be beaten and handcuffed?
