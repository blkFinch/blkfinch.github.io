First appears referenced in early medieval Arabic sources (Late 8th/early 9th century) in *The Book of Causes*
Foundational to [[Alchemy]] 

Credited to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] 

A translation of the tablet by Isaac Newton was found among his alchemical papers. Here is his translation of the text:

>Tis true without lying, certain and most true.  
    That which is below is like that which is above and that which is above is like that which is below  
	to do the miracle of one only thing  
	And as all things have been and arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.  
	The Sun is its father, the moon its mother,  
	the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.  
	The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.  
	Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.  
	Separate thou the earth from the fire,  
	the subtle from the gross  
	sweetly with great industry.  
	It ascends from the earth to the heaven and again it descends to the earth  
	and receives the force of things superior and inferior.  
	By this means you shall have the glory of the whole world and thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.  
	Its force is above all force,  
	for it vanquishes every subtle thing and penetrates every solid thing.  
	So was the world created.  
	From this are and do come admirable adaptations where of the means is here in this.  
	Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.  
	That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished and ended.

This is the first known source for the second principle of [[Hermeticism]] 
>That which is below is like that which is above and that which is above is like that which is below  

[[As Above, So below- As below, so above]]
