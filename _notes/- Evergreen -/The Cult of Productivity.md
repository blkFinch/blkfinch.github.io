Repurposing the tools of self mastery towards the ends of maximizing "productivity". There is an intense pressure to "produce" in capitalist culture because that production is the life blood of capitalism. Because of this- proponents of "productivity" rarely question if *maximizing output* is actually a worthwhile goal.

Many find great benefits in this pursuit- but this seems to be that being a whole and integrated person who is healed from trauma responses allows someone to be *more productive*. And so the healing of self comes not as the goal itself but as a step towards *maximizing output* 

unhealthy. possibly dangerous. 

However these tools can be used for diverse purposes and should not be ignored. The [[The Slipbox note taking method]] for example is a brilliant tool for engaging with knowledge, and borders on [[Magic]] as it becomes its own intelligence -- [[The Zettelkasten is a magical object]].


*todo: note this may have connections with obsession with personal mastery -- see: [[Catharsis is not healing]] -- desire to be "fixed" and move on*
