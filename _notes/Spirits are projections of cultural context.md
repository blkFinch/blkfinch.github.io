Most "negative" or scary experiences that people have with spirits or other occult forces come from  the cultural context. If we experience a *sleep paralysis demon* we understand it through the Judeo-Christian framework of "demons" which we understand to be evil and scary--- but this fear comes from that context if we look to a different context- perhaps the Hindu pantheon we can see that outwardly terrifying entities like Kali or other Dakini are actually beneficient dieties. We can then apply this context to our sleep paralysis demon ***and instead of percieving the 'demon' as evil we instead understand the experience as being visited by a guide, protector or initiator on our spiritual path***

__Cultural context can allow us to better understand and integrate spiritual experiences__

#todo _this is a great concept but how do we build to it?_
