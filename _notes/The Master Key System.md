_Charles F. Haanel_

### Part 4
About the ego. The trues self is not the mind or body. The true self controls the mind and body. The personality is a collection of traits and habits but is not the true self (ego). 
_This book uses ego to refer to the true self_

- Selfish thought is the core of failure. All transactions must benefit all parties. __this is because the indivdual is part of the universal... and one part can not truly antagonize another part.__ _pg 71_
- _I can be what I will to be_ (powerful affirmation)
- Gaining absolute control of the self unlocks the reflection of our decisions in the outside world.

_the universe can not express itself through you if you are busy with your own plans- still the mind and concentrate upon the source within_
- visualize the events which could transpire to bring you into greater purpose
- The grander the vision you can imagine the more the universe will use you

seek silence:
> power comes through repose, it is in the Silence that we can be still, and when we are still we can think, and thought is the secret of all attainment.
