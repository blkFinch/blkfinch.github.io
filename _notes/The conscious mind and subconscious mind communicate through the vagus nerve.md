According to [[The Master Key System|The Master Key]] , the conscious mind is connected to the cerebral spinal nervous system, and the subconscious mind is connected with the sympathetic nervous system. The conscious mind experiences the external world through the nervous system and is able to make judgements based on sensory stimulus. These judgements are passed through the Vagus nerve to the gut which is the home of the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind then acts through the sympathetic nervous system to regulate the body in response to these judgements.

__Important to note:__
- The subconscious mind is blind beyond the judgements coming through the vagus nerve
- This connection is referred to as the Gut Brain Axis
