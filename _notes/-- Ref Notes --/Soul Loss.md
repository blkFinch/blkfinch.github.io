Soul loss the process through which, during traumatic events, a part or all of the soul leaves the body. This occurs to protect the victim from the worse effects of the trauma and saves the soul from experiencing destruction. 

>I once worked with a man who broke his arm and had no memory of feeling any pain at the time of the incident. Breaking an arm hurts. It hurts a lot! From a shamanic point of view, the part of my client that couldnâ€™t handle the pain simply left.

_Ingerman, Sandra. Soul Retrieval: Mending the Fragmented Self (p. 22). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.

In the shamanic modality- this lost part of the soul is thought to still be alive, just residing somewhere else. The shaman can travel through the mental sphere to find this lost soul and bring it back to become reintegrated with the rest of the identity. 

The symptoms of soul loss are typically seen in dissociative behaviors. They are typified by feelings of depression, emptiness, and longing. 

The part of the soul that leaves carries with it some parts of the original identity which causes these dissociative symptoms, and sometimes can even take with it memories.
