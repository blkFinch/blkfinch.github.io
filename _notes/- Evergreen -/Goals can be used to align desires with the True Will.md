Because [[Intentions, Goals, and Desires exist on a spectrum of Order to Disorder]] we can use this relationship to align our actions with our true will.

As we become more clear on our Will we can begin to intuit core values. 
< Values are expression of [[The Will]] >

Because goals are internally consistent collections of [[Desires]], if we coordinate our desires into goals that are aligned with our values we will be acting in closer accordance with our will.

Confirming that our desires align with our Ideals and our Goals align with our desires. we can easily confirm that our actions will bring us to the correct destination if they align with our goals. [[Right Action Leads to Right Results]]

>**The will being a lever, a fulcrum is necessary; this fulcrum is the main aspiration of the student to attain**. All wills which are not dependent upon this principal will are so many leakages; they are like fat to the athlete.  
The majority of the people in this world are ataxic; they cannot coordinate their mental muscles to make a purposed movement.**Â They have no real will, only a set of wishes, many of which contradict others**. The victim wobbles from one to the other (and it is no less wobbling because the movements may occasionally be very violent) and at the end of life the movements cancel each other out. Nothing has been achieved; except the one thing of which the victim is not conscious: the destruction of his own character, the confirming of indecision. Such an one is torn limb from limb by Choronzon.
