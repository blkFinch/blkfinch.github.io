one of the [[Four Powers of the Sphinx]]

associated with [[The Four Primary Elements]] : Water

An interesting rule and one often associated with the vows of secrecy taken within initiatory orders. 

### Possible Interpretations
#### Keeping Secret
Actual Hiding of secrets- this was important during the Christian Domination era where magicians would be prosecuted badly if they were discovered to be preforming [[Gnostic]] rituals.

#### Continence
The act of withholding ejaculation is often associated with magical practices. Tibetan Tantric vows require this, and many turn of the century thinkers were proponents of this as well -- notably [[William W. Atikinson]] who was believed to be one of the authors of [[The Kybalion]] 

Because [[Speech is a magical tool]] that represents the Creation and deployment of [[The Will]] into[[The Material Plane]] , we can think of _keeping silent_ as synonymous with _with holding generative energy_ .

#### Meditation
Keeping Silent can also refer to _inner silence_ and the need to quiet the conscious mind to allow the inner Will to shine forth.
