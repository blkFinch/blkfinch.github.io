In *The 12 and 12* the authors write, regarding the 3rd step, that choosing to bind our will to something greater can lead us to greater freedom. They give the example of the electric grid. When we connect our house to this grid we no longer have the freedom to just travel with our homes like a nomad but we gain access to such a great power that we have even more freedom to perform other functions.

In the OTO this sentiment is repeated as one of the initiated secrets.

Yoga means "Yoke" or to bind-- refering to *binding the mind* so that we can get liberation from mundane life. 

In describing [[The Magic Circle]], Crowley notes that it represents *Limitation* and *affirms the Magicians commitment to the great work*. This limitation and oath making of the magician are indeed acts that grant him his freedom.

***By giving up full independence we gain even greater liberty than we could achieve alone***

We can then apply the Second Law of [[Hermeticism]] ([[As Above, So below- As below, so above]]) to theorize that the more of our independence we give up the greater liberty we will attain[^1]. Thus the fear of losing oneself entirely in the infinite source of the [[Godhead]] is illusion as that ultimate loss of oneself will only lead to the most ultimate liberty.
