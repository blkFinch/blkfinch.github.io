If [[Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will]] then [[Ceremony]] is the visible part (the material part) of the process. [[Magic]] encompasses a whole sequence of spiritual, mental, and physical effects. The magical ceremony then almost acts as metaphor for the unconscious processes that are playing out during a magical working.

For example, when we physically draw a pentagram and invoke the element of Air- that physical gesture represents a deeper alignment mentally around all the concepts represented by air.

Just as [[By creating magical tools, we are creating important symbols in the astral planes]] - by performing actions in the ceremony, we also perform enacts within the [[Astral]] plane (or the subconscious mind depending on which lens you are using)
