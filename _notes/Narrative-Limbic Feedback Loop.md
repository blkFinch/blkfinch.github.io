The Narrative-Limbic feedback loop refers to the process in which our Limbic system in the brain- which is the part of the brain responsible for processing emotions, memory, and spatial reasoning- becomes confused and begins to use imagined or un real "memories" and input to process emotional and behavioral response. 

This occurs commonly when creating and working with [[Hypersigils]] - this process is designed to "trick" the Limbic system into treating our *imagined narrative* as a *lived experience*.
