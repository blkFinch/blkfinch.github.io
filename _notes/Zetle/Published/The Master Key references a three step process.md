In [[The Master Key]] , part 5, Haanel writes of a *mental estate* (which reminds me of the [[mind palace]]) - this estate, at least in part 5 of the book is used as a metaphor for the bounty of mental control--that inside our minds we have great power to change our lives entirely.

Haanel asserts that we can access this power- _'gain this estate'_ - by the following:

>16. To gain this estate, __three processes are necessary__ : you must earnestly desire it, you must stake your claim, you must take possession


This sounds very similar to the [[Three Steps to Become Someone]] that I have been considering.
The honest desire is step 1, staking our claim is like becoming ready and willing to change, and the _taking possession_ is exactly step 3- making the decision / taking the action
