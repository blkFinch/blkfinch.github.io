While both [[Lucid dreaming]] and [[Shamanic Dreaming]] both occur in the dream state- the *Shamanic Dream* as it is described by authors like [[Faustus Crow]] or [[Sergio Magana]] seems to be more akin to a hypnagogic trance rather than a full blown dream. 

However it is possible that Shamanic Dreaming is simply a Lucid Dream that is entered into from waking akin to the [[WILD method]] of lucid dreaming.
