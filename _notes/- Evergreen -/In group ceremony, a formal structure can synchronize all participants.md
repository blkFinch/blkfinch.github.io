When performing [[Ceremony]] in group spaces, a more formal structure can be useful. While [[Ceremony can be intuitive and improvised]] , in a group setting it is beneficial to have a more formalized structure. This way, all participants can understand the actions -- [[We should understand the meaning of ceremonial actions]] ( [[Participating in ceremony and ritual embeds the symbolic meanings into our subconscious]]) , and be synchronized in intention. *i.e. when the priest draws the eastern pentagram, all participants intend for the element of air to be evoked*
