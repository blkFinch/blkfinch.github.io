### General Practice
Most lucid dreaming practice involves mindfulness practice during the day to create the awareness of the dream state. Keeping a dream journal to build solid memory of dreams. And keeping a consistent sleep schedule that allows for several full REM cycles a night (*in bed by 10 up before 8 ideally*)
