During the [[Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram]] the magician is imagining and declaring the [[The Four Primary Elements]] into their traditional quadrants around the place of working. 

>With some poetic license, it’s as if he says to each of the elements “Look! I am the focus of pure consciousness! You belong to me, not I to you! Take your place, where you should exist with the other elements in proportion and beauty!”

This act centers the magician as the orchestrator of the Microcosm, and the master of the material plane.

>Probably the most known ritual to beginners is the _Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram_ which is taught in our [**Liber O**](https://keepsilence.org/the-equinox/1.2/liber-o_low.pdf). _In it,_ **_the magician symbolically declares himself the center of his own universe_**, and then, _like a maestro conducting an orchestra,_ **_he places each of the four elements in its proper place by the Holy Names._**

>In front of him he places the __Air, the magick sword of the Son’s Reason__ with which one can analyze the most complex ideas down to indivisible unity. Behind is the __Water, the cup of Mother’s Emotions__, with which you can embrace the universe in beauty and proportion. On the right is __Fire, the Wand of the Father’s Will__ with which he leads Chaos to produce Order. To the left, __Earth, the pantacle of the Daughter's Form__, with which she sustains and nourishes all things.
