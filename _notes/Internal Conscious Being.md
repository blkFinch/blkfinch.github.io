This is my catch all term for any being that has its own form of conscious being-ness and is still internal to our own consciousness. This term includes but is not limited to:
- golems
- [[servitors]]
- tulpas
- elementals (Bardon's definition)

It may or may not include elementaries as Bardon uses the term as they may lack consciousness as we understand it.

This can be used to refer to [[Egregores]] but remember that the egregore exists internal to a group consciousness and as such may not function exactly the same as an ICB
