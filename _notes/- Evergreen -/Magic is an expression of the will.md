[[Magic]] is a tool through which [[The Will]] of the magician can be expressed into the world.

To express the will in the world can be very simple- I am thirsty, I will to have water, I stand and get some water ([[Action is preceded by desire]]) . The material action of standing and getting water is the vehicle of will in this example.

However in some scenarios, there is no direct material action we can take to express the Will. 

This is why [[The central operation of Magic is the alignment of the magician with their true will]]. 

**Hypothesis:**
- Magic provides the will with a material vehicle to express itself which allows it to manifest in the material world.
- The more in alignment with the will, the more powerful the magic - [[The effectiveness of a magical working is proportional to its alignment with the will of the operator]]
