- just testing a daily note. lets see how it can fit into my flow
- should get processed when I process notebook?
- I want to take this slow so I dont bloat my system like I did with my last notion space

#### idea for managing published status
#todo 
- move vault out of `_notes` 
- have `published_notes` folder
- from vs code copy `published_notes` contents to `_notes` 
- _can be done with rake task_
