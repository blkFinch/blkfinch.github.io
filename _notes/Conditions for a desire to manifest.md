**For [[Desires]] to manifest they must meet both these conditions:**

1.  I must believe it is possible in material reality
2.  I must be willing to accept the result NOW (not soon or someday but I must be willing to receive the result immediately)

[[For magic to work the result must be possible]] 

These are accepted occult theory - part 1 was suggested by Crowley in Magick in Theory and Practice as well as Levi and other contemporary occultists. Part 2 is a fundamental theory of Manifestation (the secret, transurfing, etc..) both these theories seem to hold true in many peopleâ€™s personal experiences.


#todo find refs for this. should be some in [[Crowley, Book Four]] , Levi, Chaos Protocols, transurfing
#in_progress
