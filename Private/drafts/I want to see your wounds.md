I want to know you deeply. I want to spread you apart and see how you work. Find the broken places inside you. The wounds, the shames, the fears. I want to see you- and see through you like glass. To see the twisted knots of anxiety at the root of all you do. I want to know why you want the things you want- what hole you think they will fill.

I want you to feel the rush of heat, and shame when you realize that hole was never really hidden. Everyone can tell, most are just too polite to mention. 

I want to find The Door where you have locked up all your memories from What Happened.
We don't have to talk about The Door. But my hand is on the knob, 
and I want you to know that I could open it whenever I want. 

I don't want to harm you- but I want to know how. I want to stick my finger gently in your wound and squeeze just enough to let you know it's still there. I want to push you closer and closer to the edge- as the cold sweaty naseous anxiety sits like a weight in your belly, and your throat tightens and hot tears begin to build behind your eyes- I want to throw open The Door and hold your face into the abyss just long enough for you to get a glimpse of what you have been hiding from all this time.

But I'll pull you back before you break. I promise. I know you can take more than you think.

I don't just want to see your wounds- I want you to show them to me. Peel back the harden layers and show me all these fragile pieces so we can look at them together. Let me hold that vulnerable softness- let me pull it out into the light and show you how easy it could break.
