A plain language compedium that seeks to broadly survey many magical topics. Geared toward the absolute beginner. Takes a strong stance on a "brain first"/psychological model of magic.

### Hand of Eris
method of sigilization / servitor creation
- Ask question about desire to deck, draw 5 cards: *(1: about the question, 2: what may help, 3: what may hinder, 4: possible outcome, 5: possible outcome)
- pick card 2 and the desired outcome and combine their names into a single sigil
- enter gnosis and bring the sigil to life and send it on its way

__this style of charging seems to be akin to the [[Death Posture]] as described by Caroll, and first coined by Spare__

### Soul Resonance
Method for banishing and casting spells. Involves, sigils, intoning the sigilized word, and visualizing the sigil
- Select three words that represent desired outcome
- Sigilize into basic shapes and colors
- Trace each sigil in the air while intoning each word (causing a vibration in the body)

### 8 circuits
Bluefluke connects the [[Eight-circuit model of consciousness]] to the sephira throughout this book. This is interesting, and could be a helpful way of pinpointing better at the correlated sphere to be invoking/working with depending on desired results.

| Circuit | Sephira |
|--------|----------|
|Survival, touch | [[Malkuth]]|
|Territory, Dom/ Sub, Emotion| [[Yesod]]|
| Curiosity, tools, conceptual framework | [[Hod]], [[Netzach]]|
|Social roles, empathy, the individual | [[Geburah]]|
| Logic, math, linguistic use | [[Chessed]]
|abstract thought, mental visualization, astral | [[Binah]] 
| Time perception, foresight, planning | [[Chokmah]]
| Illumination, collective networking | [[Kether]]

I am not so sure these correspondences resonate with me . For example I would consider *logic, math, linguistic use* to be more in the sphere of hod. Perhaps these can all map to the lower spheres leading up to tipareth, as above tipareth we enter into the colelctive consciousness. 

### Spirits, Local and non local
Good section on creation of spirits and dealing with external spirits. Makes distinction between consciousness created by ourselves and potential external entities. Bluefluke considers these local spirits like a more sentient form of servitor
