### the circle 
Symbolism of the circle when performing ritual

The circle represents the infinite and centers the magician within it. It affirms balance since the magician is centered within it. Limitation is represented by the circle. This represents The Great Work as the magician has chosen the path of attainment instead of absolute freedom. 

> He chooses a circle rather than any other lineal figure for many reasons; e.g., 1. He affirms thereby his identity with the infinite.
 >2. He affirms the equal balance of his working; since all points on the circumference are equidistant from the centre.
>  3. He affirms the limitation implied by his devotion to the Great Work. He no longer wanders about aimlessly in the world.
