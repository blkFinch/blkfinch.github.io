LBRP performed in astral

called spirits. called Axtir who appeared in my mind as an eagle. He lead me to TW. Upon arrival I asked permission to enter her field. I felt her energy open and invite me inside. I then found myself falling.

I was on a river bank. TW as a child, maybe 8 or 9, has been hooked by a fishhook. She is scared and doesn’t know what to do. There is another child there that seems to be teasing her. I wrap the child in bubble and send him away. I remove the fishhook. and console the young TW.

I then see her as she is now- but dressed in pith helmet and carrying a machete. She is hacking away at dense brush. I ask why she is not using the path that is well worn and I sense that she has immense pride in being self sufficient. I suggest that there will be time to use the machete but she should use the path that exists for her until she gets to a place where her skills will be better put to use. 

I return. I thank her and return to my body

LBRP, Invocation

Last night received email inviting me to proceed to the Neophyte initiation. I slept on it.

prayed for guidance this morning. Imagined my holy guardian angel descending into my heart through the top of my head. It was obvious that my will was to continue with the curriculum. I never had any doubt but I thought it wise to formalize the decision.

Afterwards I responded to the email saying I wanted to proceed.

11 pm

I wrote poetry tonight for the first time in a long time. It is poetry of future things to happen so perhaps it will act as a bit of a hypersigil. I should write more

upset and impatient with how long it will take to be initiated as a neophyte. It will be another 7 months until I receive my initiation. I could have done it in november- but it would be scheduled at the same time as that wedding in mexico. I have a feeling I should go to the wedding, and I can sense it will be beneficial for me to learn patience with my development. 

I am frustrated nonetheless. everything seems wrong right now

upon arrival in my hotel in Syracuse NY I performed lbrp in the hotel room. I had a lot of anxious energy.

After banishing I laid down and tried to listen to my guidance. I felt like the energy that flows through my subtle body was shaky and unsteady. I wonder if my constant experimentation with various magical modalities is causing a diffusion of my power. I tend to approach magical practice with a small amount of cynicism- as if I can understand the underlying truth of the various practices without needing to be an adept on that specific path of teaching.

I have been humbled by seeing the power T displays in her sincerity and commitment to tradition. I should whole heartedly commit to my studies and truly be able to properly perform the ceremony I practice.

However since the empowerment I have tried some reiki on myself and it does not feel quite as powerful.

I’m covered in chalk and crucified but I am able to step out of that body and look down over the cliffs to see many people wearing white robes all circling around a hole in the earth.

After some time of laying in silence I felt more clear that my heart is ready to be in union with a partner that I view as an equal. I have protected myself from intimacy by seeking situations that would not allow for it.

I then rose, and drew a door in the air facing east. Through the door I imagined my life not as a solitary man but as part of a partnership with another. I then made an oath to allow myself to join with a partner and stepped through the door. 

For the rest of the evening I felt sort of bubbly and happy.

Fill my belly so that you may eat
take my left arm to meter out compassion
and take my right to hand out justice
Take my throat that you may speak
and take my mind that you may think

LBRP, practice NOX

After banishing I went over the signs of NOX and practiced them.

# MR-79 -- August 27, 2023 : Evocation — Hagenti *

Title: MR-79 -- August 27, 2023 : Evocation, lesser key

Activities: Evocation, lesser key

9pm

H came and together we attempted to evoke the demon Hagenti from the lesser key.

I drew the triangle of art on floor in chalk and placed the black mirror inside it. beside it i lit a white candle. because hagenti is a spirit of a mercurial nature, I thought sandalwood would be good to burn as I did not have any storax.

H sat in front of the mirror Scrying while I sat beside him reading the invocations. The operations we performed:

- lbrp
- lbrh
- preliminary invocation: “bornless one”
- the first invocation

When I finished the first invocation H said he saw an ox in the mirror- H described what he saw while I took notes:

I asked for spiritual guidance on the nature of silence

- a chalice with water, wine is poured into the chalice
- a door opens, the door becomes a tunnel
- a candle
- he is being led by hagenti down a tunnel. hagenti wears a gold chain
- hagenti opens his mouth, h comments on his teeth
- dark sphere with gold in center
- hand holds sphere
- smell of roses and sulfer
- we are wrapped in white cloth
- the white cloth forms a U
- H drinks water, say Hagenti tells me to drink water
- “if there was a way it would be hidden, but there is another way”

During the session I realized that what H was describing sounded like hebrew letters: mouth - peh, door- heh, hand - caph, etc… I started writing these down without telling H. **notable**: I had forgotten to write down mem for water, and H said that hagenti was telling me to “Drink the water” he made this point as if he would not go on until I had. I was confused at first- but then realized that water had a hebrew letter association and wrote it down- H then moved on with the vision.

At the end of the vision my thoughts were confirmed when H said that on Hagenti’s medallion was a letter- he drew it for me: a perfect *lamed*

The letters I recognized from his vision:

| water | M | 40 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| door | H | 5 |
| candle | maybe I | 10 |
| mouth | P | 80 |
| teeth | Sh | 300 |
| hand | K | 20 |
| on medallion | lamed | 30 |

However when I tried a gematric analysis on this word I could not find anything particularly interesting. Adding the base values gives 485 which in 777 corresponds to “Mockeries”. Was this a joke? I don’t know. I tried using the ending values of the various letters and found no interesting results

Perhaps I will revisit this and try again in the future.

The word (in the order of appearance — corrected with water appearing first as in the chalice):

MHIPShKL

*note: I just ran the above word through google translate and got the english translation of ‘from the psyche’*

after banishing, invoked venus with hexagrams.

laid down and created light body hovering above me. I then entered through a door with the symbol of venus on it. I saw many colors like light reflected through shards of glass.

Felt anxiety at first but then relaxed and felt peace. Returned to my body.

NIA

Went with the intention of finding the Azazel character again. At first saw a horrific scene of blood and a child being chopped up. stone.  Felt Azazel as a voice. I asked him for guidance in my life and he seemed uninterested. He said if I didn’t know what to do to just wait until I did.

POP

In pop I stand before a great banquet table. A giant man with a beard and a crown of mistle and candles sits across from me. He tells me his name is OGREPAN and he is the king of this realm. He invites me to his banquet. I now notice many white and shadowy creatures that gather around the banquet table. The food looks delicious. I taste it and the sense is very vivid. The food is very delicious. I eat some sort of roast bird with cranberry sauce. The more I eat the more I want to eat.

OGREPAN tells me this realm has some connection to the experience of sustaining life. I ask him about how the Aires relate to the human consciousness and he tells me that I misunderstand- that I am not looking at the relationship of consciousness to aethyr correctly. I ask him to explain but I can not understand what he says. I see a wheel with my ego in the center and as I move the aethyrs move with me. I feel I don’t have the language to understand what I am being shown

I want to continue eating but I know it is time to go. The food tastes better the more I eat. I am served a large brick of what appears to be clear jello but when I eat it , it has no taste. This seems to break the spell and I am able to thank my host and leave.
