first wake up early, then give into sleepiness after lunch

- avoid screens for at least 15 minutes before nap time
- nap at same time every day
- _try progressive muscle relaxation__
- while laying down, focus on  lowering heart rate. _count for 60 beats then listen for 60 beats_
- once heart rate is slowed, then clear mind
- set an alarm and dont snooze
