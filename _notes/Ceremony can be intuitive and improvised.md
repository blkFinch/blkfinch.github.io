It seems as though only the decision that a space or action become ceremonial is needed for the experience of [[Ceremony]] to be effective. This means that not all ceremony needs to be rigid in its form or meaning.

Once in the ceremonial space, we can intuitively flow with the experience, although it does seem important that we understand the meaning of the actions we take even if they are improvised ([[We should understand the meaning of ceremonial actions]])
