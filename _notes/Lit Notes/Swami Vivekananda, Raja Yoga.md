Mastering truth gives the aspirant the power of speaking into existence new truth

> *36. By the establishment of truthfulness the Yogi gets the power of attaining for himself and others the fruits of work without the works.*
>
>When this power of truth will be established with you, then even in dream you will never tell an untruth, in thought, word or deed; whatever you say will be truth. You may say to a man " Be blessed," and that man will be blessed. If a man is diseased, and you say to him, " Be thou cured," he will be cured immediately.
