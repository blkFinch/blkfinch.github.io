>Pace and rhythm are very important to a caning scene. I believe that __it takes about 4-7 seconds to process a cane stroke__. An inexperienced Top would throw a batch of strokes at a bottom and then wonder why the bottom isn't processing well or safewords much faster than they expected. __Allow the bottom to process the cane stroke before delivering another and the play can continue much longer and more intensely. Warm up is also really important for canes.__ Unless you like the corporal punishment style, that is.
