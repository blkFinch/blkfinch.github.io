My working theory is that there is a fundamental pattern to most magical practices. We can look to successful operations and they should mostly contain or be part of the following sequence

- purify 
- destroy blockage [[Banishing]]
- set intent
- enter hyper reality (or altered reality) [[The Magic Circle]]
- Actively choose intent
- Leave hyper reality and *integrate* (sealing) (ecology check/integrate)

*Ultimately it may be as simple as making a decision: [[There are three fundamental steps in making a true decision]]*


Almost all magical and mystical practices begin with a [[Banishing]] of some sort, or a purification process.

==Can This process be represented using the [[Chaldean Scheme]] ?==
- Initiate
- Maintain
- Protect
- Execute
