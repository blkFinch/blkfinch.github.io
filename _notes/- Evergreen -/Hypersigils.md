A hypersigil is a type of [[Sigil]] or encoded [[Desires]] that is encoded not as a visual symbol but as a narrative or any work of art that changes. [[Hypersigils are sigils extended into the fourth dimension]] :
The desire is conveyed through narrative tools like character and drama, but these tools can be applied to any work of art like music, dance, or performance - not just writing. 

The theory behind hypersigils is closesly related to the idea of Anti-Mimesis or [[Life imitates art]]. If the natural world  will inevitably form itself around art then it makes sense to create art in a way that will cause the world to change in a manner in accordance with our desires. 

Because [[Hypersigils are formed by deeply identifying with a narrative work]], there exists the danger with any great art that we may become transfixed by it- and the tragedy that befalls its characters may befall us in kind- creating [[Negative Hypersigils]]

> THE BLACK BOOK is a form of what is called a hypersigil. **A hyper sigil is a long-form narrative work of magic. In our case, it takes the form of a journal of events or things we would like to experience that haven't happened yet, written as a diary of things that have
already come to pass.** That may be a confusing concept, so let's break it down. Imagine you wanted a new guitar or another musical instrument. In many forms of magic, we would ask for what we want using a statement of intent, petition, or by evoking a spirit and asking for it directly**. In the Black Book, we will write about already having what we desire in our 'diary', in as much detail as we can. We embellish this 'diary entry' to such a degree that we can feel it, taste it, smell it, and we use certain cues to anchor the experience in our consciousness**. We work towards our desires through as many diary entries as needed, to flesh out all aspects of how we want things to be in our life. **We treat the Black Book in
specific ways to help it become and remain magically active**.
