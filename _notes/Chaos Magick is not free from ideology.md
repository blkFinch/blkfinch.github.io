title: Chaos Magick is not free from ideology

[[Chaos Magick]] operators often seem to think of themselves as being "above belief" and that they are able to use belief as a magical tool.
This then tends to turn into a sort of smug superiority:

>What rather frightens non-chaos magicians is the ability for chaos magicians
to get results while treating the paradigms in which they dwell with such a
cavalier attitude. Nothing frustrates a 'true believer' more than someone
who acts like a 'true believer', because he has to do it in order to get
what he wants; and then is no longer a 'true believer' once he gets what he
needs.

But this is of course its own sort of belief structure and ideology. It is post modernism: [[Chaos Magic is Post Modernism applied to Magic]]
