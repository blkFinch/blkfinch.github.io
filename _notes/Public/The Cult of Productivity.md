Repurposing the tools of self mastery towards the ends of maximizing "productivity". There is an instense pressure to "produce" in capitalist culture because that production is the life blood of capitalism. Because of this- proponents of "productivity" rarely question if *maximizing output* is actually a worthwhile goal.

Many find great benefits in this pursuit- but this seems to be that being a whole and integrated person who is healed from trauma responses allows someone to be *more productive*. And so the healing of self comes not as the goal itself but as a step towards *maximizing output* 

unhealthy. possibly dangerous.
