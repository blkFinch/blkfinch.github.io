When used in spiritual manners, simply clenching the pelvic floor is not enough, the **ischiocavernosus muscle** at the base of the penis must relax and the ejaculatory energy should be coaxed up the spine. This muscle can be engaged or relaxed with practice. For people who have penises this muscle can be located by "twitching" the erect penis upwards.

### To Perform
- While being stimulated, turn focus inwards. Imagine the pleasure and desire energy as traveling up your spine from your root. Imagine it as a warm beam of light that travels up your spine in waves and illuminates the inside of your skull
- Allow yourself to feel preliminary smaller "orgasms" - it's ok if it feels like you are "faking" it- it is training your body. Allow each small pre-orgasm to spread through your body like a warm wave.
- Continue in the manner until you feel an ejaculation about to burst
- Clench the pelvic floor (like a kegel) tightly and relax the ischiocavernosus muscle 
- Focus all attention onto the spiritual north above your head and feel the energy travel up your spine
- It can help to turn your eyes up, breath deeply, and suck in your gut to coax the ejaculate up the spine
- It should feel as if your whole body is trembling
- It is ok to allow the legs to shake if you need but this diffuses some of the energy that we are trying to direct up our spines
