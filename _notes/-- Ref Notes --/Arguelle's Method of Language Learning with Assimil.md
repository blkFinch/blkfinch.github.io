1. Listen to Audio of lesson and attempt to speak along with the audio without looking at or having seen the text
2. Next listen and shadow the Audio while reading the English text- for _global understanding_
3. Shadow the audio while reading the 2nd language text
4. Read the 2nd language and refer to English to help with understanding
5. read notes, and complete exercises

>He starts with "blind shadowing," trying to speak along with the audio without having seen the text before. - He repeats the text while looking at the English translation to get a global understanding. - He shadows the text a third time while reading the French and referring to the English when unsure. - He then reads through the French text, referring to the English text and notes to ensure understanding.
