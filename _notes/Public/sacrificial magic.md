I find this topic interesting. I personally find the act of animal sacrifice abhorrent. Yet I allow it to occur on my behalf daily as I eat meat. Could I kill my own food even for sustenence? 
Ritual sacrifice (animal or otherwise) has been used throughout history across the world for many different reasons. It is worth discussing and not simply casting off as a "barbaric" relic of a bygone era. 

### Crowley, liber LXX
In this libri, [[Aleister Crowley]] describes the ritual sacrifice of a frog. 

In this [forum thread](https://www.lashtal.com/forums/magick/torturous-animal-sacrifice/) from 2008 there is some lively discussion about this topic
- is there a such thing as a moral right and wrong?
- **is the sacrifice nessesary or is it representative of an initiatory experience?**
