Because [[Desires eat each other when they conflict]] we can perform a sort of [[sacrificial magic]] by "feeding" a lesser desire to a greater one. [[Austin Osman Spare]] proposed this idea initially. His process is simple:
1. Choose the primary desire
2. wait until a desire of equal intensity arises 
3. in that moment release the new desire into the chosen desire
