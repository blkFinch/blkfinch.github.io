An open question.

Many magicians have answered in different ways but we can see certain patterns emerge:
- Crowley, [[Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will]]
- Spare, [[Magic is but one's natural ability to attract without asking]]

We can see that magic involves some sort of change to the external environment. And that [[Magic is an expression of the will]] .

Magic, intuitively stands against secular culture, but on closer inspection we may find that there is little within magical practice that is inherently superstitious or uninformed. In fact, we see many originally "occult" principals on full display within secular society but they have been sanitized of cultural understanding and rebranded to be instrumentalized by capitalism and the [[The cult of productivity]].
