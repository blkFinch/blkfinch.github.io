> Zettelkasten is usually mentioned as a note-taking method. However, t**he end goal of Zettelkasten is not gathering and collecting notes, but rather creating a competent and knowledgeableÂ communication partner.**

> **The main interaction with the slip-box is not when we are writing and adding new notes, because the slip-box is not there to be an archive of our memory and knowledge. Slip-box is there to be an apparatus with which we think. Therefore, the main interaction is when we communicate with the slip-box by confronting ourselves and our thinking with our prior knowledge.**
