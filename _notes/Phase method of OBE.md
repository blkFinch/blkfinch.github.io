Upon awakening, do not move or open eyes. Simply get up out of your body.

>Each time you wake up again, try not to move or open your eyes. Instead, immediately try to separate from your body. Up to 50% of success with indirect techniques comes during this simple first step – one that is so simple that people don’t even suspect that it could work.

>During the second lesson at School of Out-of-Body Travel seminars, participants are asked to explain in their own words how they were able to separate, but without using the words “easily”, “simply”, or “as usual”. They are usually always unable to comply with this request, as separation nearly always occurs for them “easily”, “simply” and “as usual” when the moment is right.
