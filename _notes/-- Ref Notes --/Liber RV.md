### On how to perform retirement
- warm and dry climate, free from bugs or noise
- eat simple food _after_ morning and evening practice
- a helper to deal with guests and daily admin

>a retired situation, <mark class="hltr-pink">simple food eaten in great moderation at the conclusion of the practices of morning and afternoon, and on no account before practising</mark>. Bodily health is almost essential, and should be most carefully guarded (See Liber CLXXXV, "Task of a Neophyte"). <mark class="hltr-pink">A diligent and tractable disciple, or the Practicus of the Zelator, should aid him in his work</mark>. Such a disciple should be noiseless, patient, vigilant, prompt, cheerful, of gentle manner and reverent to his master, intelligent to anticipate his wants, cleanly and gracious, not given to speech, devoted and unselfish. With all this he should be fierce and terrible to strangers and all hostile influences, determined and vigorous, increasingly vigilant, the guardian of the threshold.

  <mark class="hltr-pink">It is not desirable that the Zelator should employ any other creature than a man, save in cases of necessity. Yet for some of these purposes a dog will serve, for others a woman.</mark> There are also others appointed to serve, but these are not for the Zelator.

### Think For Yourself!
Note the final line of this book:

>17. Let the Zelator attach no credit to any statements that may have been made throughout the course of this instruction, and<mark class="hltr-yellow"> reflect that even the counsel which we have given as suitable to the average case may be entirely unsuitable to his own</mark>.

This is really important to note that we each need to apply these practices in a way that makes sense in our life.
