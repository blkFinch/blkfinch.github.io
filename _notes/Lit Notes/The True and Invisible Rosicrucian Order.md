## The Invisible Church
The invisible church of the rosicrucians ([[The Rosicrucian Grand Lodge]]) is accessed through the path depicted on The Moon XVIII:

>Yet there have been critics who say the manifestoes must be a hoax, because nobody ever saw The House of the Holy Spirit! In truth, it is probable that considerably more than a hundred thousand persons have seen it by this time. Thousands of others, though some nearly see it, do not, after all, behold that glorious structure. Let it be ours to affirm that it is a real building, though unseen, more marvelous than any of this world's other wonders. ==Let it be ours to declare that the way to it stands open today, as in the past, and that none shall fail to find it who seek diligently in the right direction. And the path that leads to it is the path pictured in the eighteenth Tarot Key==

## Darkly Splendid World
>==Stoop not down into the Darkly Splendid World==; where in continually lieth a faithless depth, and Hades wrapped in clouds, delighting in unintelligible images, precipitous, winding, a black, ever-rolling Abyss; ever espousing a body unluminous, formless and void. Stoop not down, for a precipice lieth beneath the earth, reached by a descending ladder which hath seven steps, and therein is established an evil and fatal force.

## Satan and Saturn
>And on the seventh day there went forth from of God a mighty Angel, full of wrath the presence gave unto him the dominion of consuming fire, and God and the outermost sphere. Eternity brought forth Time; to Limit; Being fall from heaven Boundless gave birth the descended into Generation. As lightning ! beheld Satan splendid in strength and fury Among the Gods is none like unto him, into whose hand are committed the the power and the glory of the worlds...kingdoms, Blessed are they who shall withstand his subtlety: they shall be called the sons of God, and shall enter in at the beautiful gates. For Satan is the doorkeeper of the Temple of the King: he standeth in Solomon's porch; he holdeth the Keys of the Sanctuary; that no man may enter therein save the anointed, having the arcanum of Hermes.â€™
