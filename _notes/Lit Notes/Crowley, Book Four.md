### the circle 
Symbolism of the circle when performing ritual

The circle represents the infinite and centers the magician within it. It affirms balance since the magician is centered within it. Limitation is represented by the circle. This represents The Great Work as the magician has chosen the path of attainment instead of absolute freedom. 

> He chooses a circle rather than any other lineal figure for many reasons; e.g., 1. He affirms thereby his identity with the infinite.
 >2. He affirms the equal balance of his working; since all points on the circumference are equidistant from the centre.
>  3. He affirms the limitation implied by his devotion to the Great Work. He no longer wanders about aimlessly in the world.

### scattered desires

> **The will being a lever, a fulcrum is necessary; this fulcrum is the main aspiration of the student to attain**. All wills which are not dependent upon this principal will are so many leakages**; they are like fat to the athlete.
The majority of the people in this world are ataxic; they cannot coordinate their mental muscles to make a purposed movement. **They have no real will, only a set of wishes, many of which contradict others**. The victim wobbles from one to the other (and it is no less wobbling because the movements may occasionally be very violent) and at the end of life the movements cancel each other out. Nothing has been achieved; except the one thing of which the victim is not conscious: the destruction of his own character, the confirming of indecision. Such an one is torn limb from limb by Choronzon.
