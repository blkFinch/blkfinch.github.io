> Most often in the pertinent literature we find magic described as a spiritual technology, often alluded to as a craft in a traditional sense i.e. an either inborn or/and learned activity involving skill in making things by hand which in return bestows the practitioner with access to certain amounts of power. As stated above, if this was the bar for excellence for the magical tradition both East and West, it has miserably failed to live up to the common standards of functionality, reliability, and utility of other traditional crafts.

Magic is not an effective craft. It's techniques are unclear and it often fails to produce the desired results 

"Magic is a relationship "

>See, if magic was defined as a relationship, it would immediately become obvious why each magician will need to walk their own path, why traditional rules will apply only with some vague sense of reliability (like your aunt’s great sure-fire advice on finding the „right“ partner), and why the measure of our success can never be judged by anyone, except for the very people (or spirits) with whom we lived in a relationship with. Each life is a genuine and new adventure, often a struggle, a Promethean ordeal in learning how to love and how to be social. In building the right relationship between oneself and the world. And so it is with magic.

The spiritual journey is not a linear growth towards some goal- it is more like a relationship that has its own ebbs and flows, that grows in richness in depth through time, willingness amd constant practice
