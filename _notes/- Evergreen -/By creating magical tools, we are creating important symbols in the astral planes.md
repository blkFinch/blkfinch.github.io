When making magical tools, it is important to remember that the physical object is not the true tool. In fact the physical object that results from the creation of a magical tool is simply the by-product of the astral work.

Because [[The Physical Plane is a Consequence of the Astral Planes]] , then it is true that to create a Magical Tool we must first create it in the finer astral planes. This is the important work of the tool.

When we create a Pantacle the benefit we gain is not from the actual completed tool but because our astral bodies had to be contorted to create the various components and symbols.

==This has some sort of effect on the soul/consciousness in the same way that Hatha Yoga has an effect on the physical body==
