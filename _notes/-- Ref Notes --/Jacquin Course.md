#### Suggestion vs Instruction
Instruction -> Tell someone to _do_ something

Implies the response will be automatic
> "Put your hands out- they will touch. They are moving..."

Start with instructions. Lead them- make sure they are following your instructions
	- be polite "would you, could you"
	- once they are set up - tell them what will happen
	- then the suggestion "they are like magnets"
Tell them what will happen

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Change a doing to a happening</mark>
- When people come in with problems- they often experience their problems as a _happening_ 

## Conversational Hypnosis
Look for an opportunity to make suggestion- during a moment of emotion. Create one or create one

>Not belief in our own ability it is belief in our clients ability to achieve their goals 

### Emotions Cause trance
- try with high sexual pleasure?
- fear
- love
- laughter
## Failure
To build muscle you need to work muscles to point of failure. Do not be afraid of failure. Failure is needed to grow. Go out and seek failure

## Imagine thats happened

>Imagine that has happened and theres nothing you can do about it

Use this for anything. "The craving for a cigarette is gone. Imagine that has happened and there is nothing you can do about that."

### Induction
Inducing an altered state that 

#### Jacquin Powerlift
_ref: Rehearsal Induction, Reality is Plastic_
Start with up and down

FIRST: demonstrate

> As you lift your hand up allow your eyes to close
> As you lower your hand allow your eyes to open, feel relaxed

_passive_ -> as you lift your hand up allow your eyes to close
_authoritarian_ -> your hand will lift and your eyes will close
_automatic_ -> as the hand lifts and your eyes close

>Lift your hand and your eyes will close
>lower your hand and your eyes will open

"This is all we are going to do"

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">__In person- you lift their hand for them__</mark>
_ambiguous touch:_ grip with two middle fingers, allow index finger to touch wrists. When hand is lifted, only touch with index finger, allow other fingers to release. Then push the hand down. during the lock- maintain touch.
##### Pattern Interrupt
Establish pattern of up, down, up, down - then interrupt by making them hold their hand up

> feel your wrist stiffen, the forearm and elbow lock into place. Allow your hand to rise- just imagine there's nothing you can do about that.

*Change tone*. As if you are stopping a child from crossing the street


### Long induction
_good for large groups_
Push and pull between self evident statements leading to vague statements, and back to the self evident.

> General rule: Start with _self evident_ statements. And then begin to make _ambiguous_ statements about the inner experience. Move back to _self evident_ then move deeper again. Like rocking a baby

***Self evident statements***: "You can hear my voice", "as you sit in that chair", "you can feel your breath"

__some ambiguity__: use 'you may'- 'you may feel your heartbeat', 'you may feel the air on your skin'
moving attention around
-> move attention toward inner experience

**Artfully Vague**: statements about inner experience. 'You may become aware of thoughts', 'you may notice an inner voice, just let it chatter on', 'you may notice yourself sinking into your mind like a comfortable cloud', 'you may notice feelings'

__Pacing Statements__ : "As you allow yourself to relax", "as you sink deeper into your subconscious", "as you allow your body to let go"

_move back to self evident statements_ : you may notice the sounds, just allow them to become background noise as you **allow** yourself to move inward -> "as the body begins to relax"

### Body twitches
Flickering eyes, hands twitching. Ask for little movements from the unconscious mind to signify that there is communication happening

> I want the client to go out of the room with no doubt that they have had a hypnotic experience.

## Class 3
### Parts Negotiation
Habits, anxieties other "protective" mechanisms can be personified as controlled by _parts_ . The _part_ of me that does the bad habit etc...

Parts negotiation is where we talk to that part.

This can be understood through soul loss / soul retrieval. There are _Protectors_ , like daemons that have been developed to protect parts of us that no longer need protection. We will banish them. [[Parts Negotiation with Daemons]]


### Steps for parts negotiation
1. Identify the part responsible for the ability. This separates the behavior from the person.
2. Ask the part if it accepts the clientâ€™s goal.
3. The Part is asked to use the creative part of the mind to find empowering memories, inner strengths, skills and abilities that satisfy the positive intention. 
4. The Part is asked to pick the best of these new choices. Depending on the behavior it may be more appropriate for it to choose three or more new choices.
5. The Part is asked to take the new choice and apply it. This can be combined with future pacing.
6. Forced Ecology Check. A check is run to ensure the new behaviours fit in with every other part of the person.

## Anchoring

- ask client to pick a gesture and key word to anchor
- make sure they have a memory of a time they felt that way
- drop them into trance
- bring them back into the memory (ask them to speak the way they would in that)
- when the emotion peaks, have them make the trigger, and say the word
- then have them release the trigger, and open eyes
- repeat 2 more times, on the third time, tell them it will lock in and **from today forward it will always bring them to that state**
