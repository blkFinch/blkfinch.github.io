## biological term

> The term atavism derives from the Latin word atavus, which can be translated 
> as ancestor or forefather, and was first coined through French medical 
> writings in the 1820s. **An atavisme was interpreted as a biological phenomenon 
> that, in the sense of a throwback or rebound', represents the reappearance 
> of anatomical features that were actually known only from more distant 
> ancestors**, but were reduced in the immediate ancestors because they no 
> longer possessed any function for the current stage of development.

The term refers to recurrence of biological patterns and forms in new species.

For example in humans, the development of a tail or a third nipple is am example of atavistic recurrence.

This means that many biological or behavioral functions may be present in many or all species of life.
## magical interpretation 
Coined by A.O. spare
The Mind and soul contain within them the knowledge of all forms.
We are constantly experiencing and can access the experience and consciousness of the many ancestral forms and animals that we evolved from and are made from.
