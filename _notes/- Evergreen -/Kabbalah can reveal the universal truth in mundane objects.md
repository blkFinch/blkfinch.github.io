When using Kaballah to “decode” sacred truths from texts it is not actually important that the text in question be written by “occult masters” who have used kaballah to encode secret messages. The truth is that Kaballah is a tool that can unravel the mysteries of the universe through any part of the universe, mundane or sacred. Watch [[Aleister Crowley]] apply kabbalistic techniques to reveal [[The occult meaning of nursery rhymes]].

This exercise shows that using a set of Magical tools, an operator and dissasemble a piece of material reality and reveal that it contains all the wisdom, and Truth of the universe. 

This is because the truth of the universe is the fabric from which the universe is made and thus **one can look anywhere in the universe and see the truth.**
