What is desire?
What I mean when I say desire. This term should be defined clearly because I use it everywhere
- [[Desires are reducible into smaller sequences of desire]]

I do not have a concise and atomic definition of Desire however we can *infer* a definition of desire by noting that all [[Action is preceded by desire]] . If all phenomena in the universe have cause- then when we trace back the cause of any action we have an undefined *urging* for that action, which I will call *desire*. 

- [[Goals can be used to align desires with the True Will]]
- [[Hypersigils]]
- [[Hypersigils are sigils extended into the fourth dimension]]
- [[Lesser wills and desires must be organized under a single aspiration to attain]]
- [[Sigils are visually encoded desires]]
