- `The Thought:` It's better to prefer simplicity then to create an over engineered solution.
	- `tldr` Over engineered solutions can break/ are hard to maintain, simplicity is better because it requires developing stronger habits
	- `rough`
#### Simple is better
if possible prefer the simplest solutions. __solutions that are simple tend to be portable__ . That means that we are not reliant on specific environments or tools to maintian our activities. In PKM this can mean not relying on specific automations or software. In engineering this means finding architectural solutions that do not rely on idiomatic behavior of specific languages or libraries
#### Natural Complexity can  grow as needed
Obviously at some point, additional layers of complexity can and will need to be added. Allow these layers to develop out of need rather than trying to predict their need. ask yourself
_"Does the work required to add this feature meaningfully improve the experience of using the system?"_ 

__pruning__ can be good. After complexity is added, take time to reflect and reduce unneeded complexity where possible
