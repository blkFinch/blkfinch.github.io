A progressive left spiritual movement could unify the left into a powerful activist force.

> I think any real effort would first need a more scientific understanding around the brain and states of conciousness. For instance [Zoran Josipovic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12661646) and [Brian Knutson](http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Stanford-studies-monks-meditation-compassion-3689748.php) have conducted research using MRI brain scans of monks and nuns in an attempt to understand meditation and a state of "unifying conciousness". There has been research done by [NYU and Johns Hopkins](http://time.com/3399433/quit-smoking-psychedelic-drugs-acid-test/) showing that psychedelics can induce spiritual experiences identical to that of monks. Anecdotally, astronauts also report [spiritual awakenings](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/communion-on-the-moon-the-religious-experience-in-space/259826/) when viewing earth from space. 

> The challenge for progressives is to realize the spiritual experience is actually a symptom of unrealized real-world politics, rather than internalizing and focusing inward on the individual experience itself. A spiritual experience externally translated might say: "When we are together, we are free." Seeing and using the spiritual awakening as a call for unrealized freedom, can be a powerful progressive force -- something MLK was able to harness. A spiritual progressive movement thus must have sufficiently strong leadership, otherwise [liberation theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) will lead to petty-bourgeoisie regression: right-wing pious objectives, moralism, and religious tribalism. 

> In economic terms, a unifying conciousness could take on many forms. A political economy already forces an individual to directly experience a collective power thrust upon them via capitalism. But capitalism also relies on the individual's labor and participation. One way to challenge the class nature of capitalism might be to abolish cash and credit. Replacing currency with stocks and bonds, means individuals are directly tied and always participating in the ownership of the means of production. This is not too far off from an experience of a "unified conciousness" where you are both participant and recipient of a greater system.

>Apologies if this is all too hand-wavey. I think a secular spirituality could neutralize or overtake the right-wing power away from moralism and religion. And a cashless/creditless economy could distribute the economy in such a way to avoid accumulation of power. Rather than focusing on full employment and distribution of wealth, the goal would be full participation in the economy through stock equity.
