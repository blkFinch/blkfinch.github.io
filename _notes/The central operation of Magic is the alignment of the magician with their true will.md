_anonymous, Ararita_

[[The Will]] , represented by the HGA, wishes to be expressed. Our [[False ego]] attachments prevent us from expressing or understanding this will. All magic is ultimately to the goal of aligning the conscious mind with the inner most Will (_which is the will of God, or the Universe for within ourselves is access to the infinite- this is the source of the Will_).
