attempted to sit in stillness and stop all thoughts while in waiting room for doctor. I was only person in room so there was no distraction. Found several moments of mental silence. Can see importance of calling upon a great will of destruction- it took a great willingness to destroy thoughts as the arose without first assessing the thought.
