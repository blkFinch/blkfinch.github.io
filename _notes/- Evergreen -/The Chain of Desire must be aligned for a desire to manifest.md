#todo *: clean this up* / split into smaller parts

### The Chain of  Desire
There exists a *Chain of Desire* between the initial impulse or desire and the physical outcome/experience of that desire. Because [[Action is preceded by desire]] and [[Desires are reducible into smaller sequences of desire]] we can express any greater desire as a sequence of smaller actions and desires. When magic fails to work properly or manifest fully -- *the problem likely lies within this chain*

### When Ritual Fails
The problem is not with the ritual but rather with the [[Desires]]. For a desire to manifest not only must it be physically possible but it also must be accepted by me. I believe the magic worked and the feeling of frustration is the magic working to bring the result but being blocked either by the confines of physical reality or by my own resistance to the success of the ritual. 

My primary theory is that this resistance to success can be circumvented by creating a linked “chain of desires” by reducing the initial desire into smaller desires-( [[Desires are reducible into smaller sequences of desire]] )and then performing ritual to achieve the first chain in the sequence. or on whichever chain link is blocked. This chain is a series of actions and desires each preceeding the next. To see any desire come to fruition- one must discover this chain, and then bind their will to the correct desires/actions so that the chain becomes complete and the desire can manifest.

assume the following [[Conditions for a desire to manifest]]
- it must be possible
- I must believe it is possible
- I want to have this result now with no reservations

The solution then is to trace backwards the chain of desires until the link is found that does not meet the required conditions for success. Ritual can then be used to correct the resistance at that link and from there the rest of the chain should fall into place like picking the stuck tumbler of a lock.

__Furthermore I believe that this process can be formalized into a sequence of steps that can be implemented by anyone to discover if the chain of desires is clear and capable of sustaining success- and if not find exactly the link that can be corrected. see [[Is there a fundamental Magical Process]] __
