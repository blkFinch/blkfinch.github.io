Before going to bed make strong the intention to not move upon awakening.
*When I awake I will not move a muscle*

Upon awakening, remain perfectly still. Do not even upon your eyelids. From here simply allow the memories of dreams to return , or use this place as a platform to reenter into dreaming

### for memory
To increase dream recall simply remain passive in this state.

> If successful we become the net through which the water of our dream recollection flows freely. It is not up to us to decide if and what gets caught in this net. We are mere observers holding ourselves in a somnambulistically light posture of neither neither.
> -  frater acher, [[Goetic Atavisms]]
