>When you’re providing dev services to a client, however, all the client is going to care about is how much value they receive out of it. If, for example, you’re building a website or app for a small business then what the business is willing to pay is going to depend on the value they expect to receive from the website or app in the future.

><mark class="hltr-yellow">The price the customer is willing to pay is not based on the time you put in (as is the case in hourly jobs). Instead it’s based on the increase in value that your customer will receive</mark>

When freelancing in web development, pricing services should be based on the expected value a person will get from the end product not on the expected labor required to produce the product.
