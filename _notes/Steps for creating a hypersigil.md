#todo review [[Aidan Wachter, Weaving Fate]] and summarize steps, clean up

1. Consecrate Book and Pen
2. Write about events you want to experience
3. Focus on the details not the specifics ([[For magic to work the result must be possible]])
4. have fun and make mistakes

## More Concepts
### Character/ Protagonist 
While the hypersigil can be any art that can be added to over time, for us to be able to apply narrative elements it must have a main character - and this character must represent us. 
It can simply **be** us if we are writing from a first person point of view. But if we are making, say a sequence of abstract images, it could be a little blue dot or other distinguishing feature that appears in all the pieces. 
This character is totemic. As it is acted upon by the narrative, so too do we. 

### Sympathetic Feedback Loop

The sympathetic feedback loop is a process of blurring the line between memory and imagination. By using the interconnected systems in the brain of memory and imagination ([[Is imagination another form of memory]]? ) we can begin to create a sensation of remembering events that havent yet happened and imagining events that will.

>The key, it seems, is to create a two way sympathetic response from creating and reading the entries.
> 
> 1. Use actual events from your life in the entries.
> 
>     - Be descriptive, connect with your sense memory
> 
>     - Connect these events to the desired event. This can be vague or nonsensical but it should be clear that there is a connection
> 
>     *ex: "I was walking Rex at the park today, by the big oak tree. The leaves were bright yellow and orange and the air had a cool chill- and thats when I was approached by a man who wanted to hire me at my dream job! Im so glad I decided to go by that park today!"
>     
>     This should create a sympathetic response to your brain as it is _remembering_ rather than imagining. Then we slip in the desire as if
>     it is part of that memory.
> 2. Write about things that you know will happen. For example- if you are going to the dentists office in the afternoon- in the morning write about what happens after the dentist. Describe the dentist visit and again connect it to the desire through some sort of causal link .
> 
> Ideally we begin to create a situation where we are both _remembering_ events that haven't happened yet, and _experiencing_ events we only
> imagined. This is like __priming a pump__ and as we begin to become more in sync with the character of our sigil- we can begin to stretch the
> bounds of that sympathetic bond.
