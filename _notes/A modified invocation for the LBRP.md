_Before me to the east is the swift sword of reason, the penetrating winds, Raphael
Behind me to the west is the mothers cup, the overflowing sea, Gabriel
To my right in the south is the rod, the heat of passion, Michael
To the left stands the green fields and sustaining rains, pantacle of earth, Auriel
All these elements to their rightful place in proportion and beauty! For in the center of the world is the gate to the infinite!_
