All things which exist- the material universes, the archetypal worlds, the [[Godhead]] - all exist on a spectrum of vibration. This is affirmed by the ***Principle of Vibration*** of the [[The Seven Hermetic Principles]] . For example, [[Matter is just the spectrum of energetic vibration that is tangible to the mundane senses]] . It is a slow and low vibration that is dense. Our emotional experiences, as well as our mental conceptions also exist on this spectrum of vibration. These finer forms, are thought to be of a higher vibration. 

We can group functions and forms at various rates of vibrations as existing within broad [[Planes of Existence]].

For example: in Platonism, there is the concept of the Platonic Ideal (*i.e. There exists many chairs but there is only one Ideal Chair which is the concept of a chair. It is how we recognize a chair we have never seen before as being a chair- because it is an emanation of the concept of "Chair"*). These Platonic Ideals can be thought of as existing in a Plane known as the [[The Plane of Archetypes]] . 

### Separation of Interaction

While there is not actually a hard division between these Planes, there is a seperation of interaction between these various ranges of vibrations, because __only vibrations of similar rates can interact with each other__. But there is some cross over as the lowest vibrations of the Astral Plane can affect the highest vibrations of the physical plane which can then act upon the lower vibrations of the physical plane

 >This Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibrationâ€”the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale.
