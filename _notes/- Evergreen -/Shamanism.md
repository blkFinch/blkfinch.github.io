## Overview

Shamanism, or Neo-Shamanism, is a collection of techniques and practices that primarily involve imaginal journeys and interactions with spirits. Common to this cosmology is the concept of [[Soul Loss]], where pieces of the soul are broken off during traumatic events, and the Shaman goes on a [[Shamanic Journey]] to reclaim the lost pieces. 

## Atavisms - A Theory of How it Works

[[Austin Osman Spare]] talks a lot about atavisms and the concept has been championed by both [[Peter Carroll, Liber Null]] and Frater Acher.

[[Atavistic resurgence]] is a biologic term that refers to the appearance of biological patterns appearing on totally separated species, for example a human being born with a tail or extra nipples. The implication from this is all animals have within them access to all other patterns of life.

in Primordial Magic then, perhaps when we enter deep into trance we are accessing some deeper universal storehouse of ancient biological patterns and behaviors. 

## My Disagreements with the Term

Shamanism as a term originates from Siberian indigenous people. When people in the Western world talk about _shamanism_ they are rarely talking about this actual cultural practice and are usually referring to an entire constellation of practices that are found in many different cultures in different forms. Not only is this inappropriate and erases the actual Buryat culture and history as well as flattens all indigenous cultures into one mono-culture- I don't think this is actually what people mean when they talk about shamanism.

Most modern practitioners are actually practicing their own blend of various imaginal techniques in ways that conform to each own practitioners personal cosmology. This is really interesting and I think it deserves it's own term rather than being attached to an existing cultural tradition. I suggest the term __primordial magic__ 
### Primordial Magic

Primordial means _existing at the beginning of time_. The implication with this name is that this is the _original magic_. I believe this to be the case. The constellation of practices at the core of _neoshamanism_ are special because they are all some of the oldest and most natural practices that we as humans all do.

When we are born we know how to Journey- as children we day dream and speak to _imaginary_ friends freely. We sing nonsense songs and drum wildly. These magical practices are natural to humans and come without needing any instruction. In fact the only reason we have lost these magical practices is because we live in a culture that requires us to sever our connection to spirit in order to function and live. As adults many of us have to relearn what once came naturally to us.

Because of this, rather than using the term _shamanism_ I want to use the term _Primordial Magic_ to refer to a specific constellation of practices that are performed instinctually by humans:

- Day dreaming, and Night Dreaming
- Speaking with spirits
- Intuitive Music Making
