after work, meditated. Pranayama was easy today. 

### 9:00 pm

Evocation of Hekate

- LBRP
- Star Sapphire
- Bornless Rite
- Recited Orphic Hymm

I draw two concentric circles on the floor with chalk and placed within the circle before me a candle and my mirror. I lit Black Poppy incense. After the initial rituals and the hymm to hekate which I recited off my phone. I sat before the mirror and repeated 

“Io Hekate Io Io!” like a mantra

After some time I felt a presence to my left which was North. I asked for help with my youtube channel. She said she could guide me- in exchange for offerings made to her. She requested I make an offering of incense every dawn for a fortnite. 

She also said she wanted to grant me a familliar named Philia, but I have not noticed any presence.

Gave thanks and leave to depart to the spirits.

### notes

Presence felt weak. No visual. Some sort of movement appeared on the mirror but nothing distinct. Communication felt vague- but I came away feeling fairly sure I should make offerings at dawn for a fortnite.

Trancework:

Laid down and let myself drop into my belly. Felt lots of anxiety come up. Fears of not being lovable. I told myself I loved me. Allowed myself to be held. Saw a vision in bed with a girl with platinum hair. We are naked and she holds me to her chest. She says she loves me and I say I love her too. I feel my heart crack open more than it has before.

Afterwards I sit at the altar and perform a balancing breath, then worked on LXV

******8pm******

This evening I had several magicians over to do a scrying of the aethyrs. We placed the tablets and sigilum under a red silk and set around the table. I wore the lamen and ring and recited the enochian as best as I could pronounce. We scryed three aethyrs: TEX, RII, and BAG

### TEX

Not much for me here I felt like I was mostly holding space for the others- waiting for a sense that I should call them back. At one point I felt the words “You are becoming” reverberate in my head. 

### RII

During this scrying I felt like I was diving into a dark blackness. In the dark I saw a young girl dressed in white. She asks me “what are you doing here?”. I return. Talking to the others after they all had the sense that they were lifted up or rising. I wonder if I need to more intentionally strive upwards instead of diving down.

### BAG

This was an intense vision for me. Very stable. I was at a banquet set up on a green grassy hill. Beautiful forest and hills around me. The empress sitting beside me, and people feasting and dancing around us.

I look down and I am bleeding from my chest onto a silver plate. The sky turns red and around me the party goers rot and turn to skeletons. the trees become gnarled and twisted. crows pick at my eyes. I look down to my plate and I make a pentagram of salt in the pool of blood. I can see the reflection of a satyr in the blood.

Suddenly I am in a great wide pool of water. A beautiful woman stands before me and tells me she is Axtir the angel. She gives me a bell with a red ribbon and gestures upwards. Above her is a road leading into the clouds surrounded by cherubs. The clouds part revealing a great kingdom. 

I am then allowed to return and signal the others to return as well

6:30 pm

Contemplation

I sat with my own thoughts for some time, contemplating my idea of myself. I noticed that I often see myself as rather solitary, so I began to let go of these ideas of my self to make room for a more connected, vulnerable, and loving conception of how I could be in the world.

some guidance came through encouraging me to work on my body and health- also mentioning there was some growth still needed in relationship to sex. Felt that big changes were coming in the spring.

8:20 pm

Was out when I received a call from R, who I have not talked to in years. She said she has been studying meditation in Arizona and that I needed to be aware of some thing that was happening in the spring, april 20th. She sounded a little disconnected, maybe from excessive meditation with no grounding. It is notable that I had just earlier gotten a mention of the spring from my own guidance as well.

4:00 pm

Trance work

Laid down and entered my astral temple with my body of light. I started digging around in my own body and started pulling out bits of black tar and throwing them on the fire beside me allowing them to turn to smoke and drift away. I finally was able to confront a part of myself that seeks to always be the victim of circumstances. I asked him why he wanted to be that way and he told me that because he wanted to be treated with kindness and the only way he knew how was from being pitied. 

Seeing this I realized and finally had the willingness to let go of this trait. I kindly burned the darkness away revealing a reptile like baby that was clean and innocent. I held it to my stomach and allowed it to reintegrate into me.

After returning to my body I feel an immense weight lift from my heart and I am filled with love for myself.

I realize now that “I” is emanating from my heart. It is my heart that says I, and I haven’t ever really felt that before. I realize my mind was covering and protecting my heart for as long as I could remember but finally I feel like I can hear myself. I could clearly hear what my will in that moment was. It was time to step through the door.

4:30

LIRP, star sapphire, door

After the preliminary rituals I said a brief prayer. I then drew a doorway facing my altar. Through the door I saw the vision of myself as a loving person who is connected and happy in a relationship. I asked “Is it my will to have this life”. My heart said “yes” and I stepped through the door with the sign of the enterer. I then made the sign of silence and felt a wave of deep happiness and love fill me.

### notes 2/19

As I record this entry I want to add in some extra notes here. At this point I had been retaining my semen for about 10 days. I do think the consistent performance of Vajrioli Mudra helped in generating enough energy to remove the blockage from my heart. Interesting to note- later this evening a person I had been talking to reached out, out of the blue, to hook up. Not sure if this person is a good match for a long term partnership but I took it as a sign of shifting energy.

After prayer I sat and tried to make as much space for the “I” emanates from my heart.

4:00 pm

made and consecrated the amulet I am using for the ritual

7:00 pm

in the evening I had guests over to do some enochian scrying. 

TEX

An androgenous blonde person sits on a red rock. They hand me a coin. The vision is not very stable.

BAG

I am faced with claws and scaled hands that grab at me. I try and give them the coin I was given. I am ushered to a boat in an underground river. Long pillars of snowy white mold rise up into the blackness. The boat itself seems to be made of mold. A fairy guides me. I ask her why I am here she laughs and tells me “you tell me, you’re the one who came here”. She seems excited to show me a hole- so I follow her in and I feel as if we pop out in a great upside down forest of white mold trees.

ZAA

I am in a great city. I see pyramids. Children play in the street. I walk beside a camel. The city is bustling with life. I hear the words “you are all of this” as I see the busy people pushing past each other. A man made of complete blackness stands before me. His head is the head of a crane or ibis. He beckons me to him. As I approach I see that he is not completely black but filled with small brilliant pin pricks of light like stars. I step inside him like a door. It is cool and dark and quiet - like I have stepped into a resting place. I can still see the busy city out through the door I came in. In this dark starry room, a woman speaks to me. She tells me to come closer and rest here. She is like a priestess of nuit I think. I feel cool, and relaxed in this blackness.

11:00 pm

After everyone was gone, I was ready for bed. However I tried to listen to my heart and it seemed that I wanted to do the amulet charging tonight as it was the new moon and a good time for it, and I was ready.

I performed LBRP, then Star Sapphire with venus hexagrams. I lit a green candle and burned benzoin. Full notes of ritual are in my notebook. The amulet represents my decision to find a long term stable partnership, and should simply act as a beacon for a person who is capable of meeting me at the point.

Aethyr Scrying: NIA

image of a candle flame. as my eyes adjust to the darkness I see now an old man like the hermit. He tells me his name is azazel and that he is my first mate. He opens his robe to reveal an ocean. I am on a boat. Then we are in an infinite dark plane with large stone columns that stretch up into the darkness.

He leads me among the pillars saying that each pillar is a human life. He leads me to a stair well , with golden light pouring out. I enter into a golden Pentagon chamber with a sun on each wall. In the middle of the room is a golden coffin lined with red velvet. two attendents wear black with white masks.

I enter into the coffin and they cover me. I am then in a white place with many white robed people. I see meat being nailed to a cross.

# mar 30

Created: April 4, 2023 9:31 PM

8:30 am

After my morning prayer and shower I decided I needed to do a ritual to facilitate the letting go of old patterns that were no longer serving me. Specifically a pattern of paralysis which arises when I am faced with accepting humility. This paralysis often prevents me from completing work that I think is less than perfect and prevents me from taking the risks and doing the work I need to in order to grow and develop.

I opened the ceremony with the Star Ruby, and a brief invocation of the elemental spirits. I drew a door in the center of the room and imagined my life free of this self bondage on the other side. I named each pattern and the defect of character connected with it and with each one I felt a chain lifted from me. When I was ready to be fully free I stepped through the door.

I felt complete in the ritual but afterwards felt negative emotions like a magical hangover. I am still unsure of what this sort of backlash means. Sometimes I think it occurs when a ritual did not take hold completely- but it is possible it is a sign of success and the emotinal response is grief over the loss of my old way of being.

# mar 31 - april 5

Created: April 5, 2023 9:13 AM

It is now 4/5/23 - I have been very ill the past week. I came down with some throat thing that laid me out for the better part of a week. I am only now feeling able to think a bit more clearly. I did not take good notes during this time and my practice suffered greatly while I was in bed most of the day.

I did manage to continue reciting LXV.

I think it is interesting that this sickness developed the day after performing my ritual to let go of old patterns. I have also been faced with a deep emotional response to a certain relationship that is developing in my life- and this fear response was also an old pattern that I have seen many times in my life. I saw the pattern this time and rather than falling into a place of fear I simply sat with my anxiety and allowed myself to wait through the emotions rather than act on them as I have before. 

The sickness, the emotional response and my willingness to walk through it all seem to point towards successful growth. 

Hopefully I can begin to return to a regular daily ritual now and find some grounding again.

Enochian Scrying: BAG and DES

Had guests over for scrying. Opened with Star Ruby ritual then read 2nd Call and then the 18th call once per aethyr. Method prescribed by shoemaker.

BAG:

Not many images. Strong feeling of being at a long table of gold and fire. A woman speaks to me. I hold two marbles on in each hand. 

DES:

I am pulled aboard a long boat. I row with the other men. I feel a lurching sensation as we go over the waves. A red clay jug rolls down the deck. The shipmaster approaches. He is huge and has the head of a boar. He tells me I don’t belong here. I ask him where I belong and he opens his mouth- his huge tongue drops out. I climb up his tongue and into his throat. Blackness but the feelings of gemstones.

I am again talking to a woman- I hold my palms out in each hand is an opalescent bead. I stand on an infinite plane of water. About an inch of water above black and white tiles. I feel I am being given a choice- to follow the spiritual path and reject the earth or to become one with the earth. I reject the choice.

Asrtral / dharana throat chakra, 40 min

Today I was able to get into the deep relaxed state that feels similar to sleep paralysis. At this point I became flustrered as I was unsure if I should continue to relax or attempt to lift out of my body. I tried both and achieved neither. Next time I should just stay focused and relaxed for now. 

5:15 pm

as I walked to meet some friends for coffee I recited LXV to myself.

S stayed over last night. did not sleep much. Had sex but did not ejaculate.

astral practice

attempted laying in bed today. too relaxed and unfocused. Basically fell asleep. 

feel groggy and frustrated afterwards

11pm

before bed I perform Star Ruby ritual. It feels different from the LBRP- sort of lower and more rooted as if resonating with the muladara chakra.

enochian scrying, aethyr: UTI

had the group over for an enochian scrying session. The vision I had for UTI was quite stable.

I was standing at the edge of a battlefield filled with the remains of a fresh battle. It was raining and dark. An old man sits by a fire beneath a gnarled tree. I sit with him and he offers me soup. He says that he is me and it frightens me so I move forward through the battlefield along an old road.

I come to a wretch who is hunched over looting the corpses. He begs me for food but I have none. I instead offer him my cloak which is of a fine felt or velvet. 

I continue on past the battlefield and there is a pregnant woman who spills a great wave of water out and floods the ground. I trudge on in the knee deep water.

I move forward and reach a castle. I speak some words in enochian (i am not sure what) and the gate to the caste opens revealing an egg wrapped with a serpent. I have no idea what I am supposed to do here.

still sick.

in the afternoon I took a walk and recited what I had memorized of my chapter of LXV. I am almost complete. One page left.

I have no real desire to practice any rituals. I just want to have this thing memorized. I wish I had started on it earlier. My pace has been much slower than expected.

***************note: the following is added as I transcribe dates 4/7 - 4/13 from my journal***************

*No work in the previous days beyond memorizing LXV. I omitted what I recorded as it mostly pertains to my romantic life. Noting here that a new relationship is developing and that I am faced with the discomfort of experiencing vulnerability with another. I think for the first time in my adult life though I am walking through this experience with dignity and sanity. It should be noted however that my practice sees a steep decline in regularity between this and being sick. what follows is my record for the 9th*

4/9

enochian scrying with group. performed star ruby, burned frankincense then read 2nd call before reading 18th call for aethyr NIA

NIA

I am standing infront of a large clock. There are seven hands each with a planetary symbol as if it is a representation of the solar system. Around the outside of the clock is a silver ouroboros. From the bottom of the clock hangs a chain that dips into a fountain of blood. It is gold on one side and silver on the other as if the blood is changing it. There is a stone lion head that is a fountain of blood.

Behind me I sense the tall figure of Azazel. I ask him what I am supposed to learn from this vision. He tells me I am not ready, too attached to material, he tells me to just wait.

The image of the clock is stable. I am alone before it.

11:00 am

Wanted to revisit NIA as that was where I met something calling itself azazel. A friend texted me with a grimiore that mentions that name. 

I put on my ring and spoke the 2nd call and the 18th call.

No visions but had strong sense of internal dialogue as if speaking to my imagining of azazel. He did not answer any questions of mine but told me to put my heart back in my chest rather than to allow others to handle it. intimacy is allowing others in not pushing my insides out. 

It felt relevant and well received. 

He also told me to  keep his sigil on a paper in my wallet.

************note as of 5/18/23: I have been keeping the sigil in my wallet but I have not yet considered making contact again************

8:00 pm

performed to the best of my ability Liber Reguli. Had to be reading from the book the whole time.

What is the Sign of the Beast? What is the invoking hexagram of beast?

Star Sapphire, Israfel

Attempted Israfel again. Wore robe and ring. performed Star Sapphire then annointed myself with abramelim oil. Burnt Frankincense. Recited from the book but when I reached the lection I began to speak off book. I said the words:

“see how I grow, this web of desire is only a trifle. I am not desire” and I fell to silence when I realized I was speaking. I sat in meditation as I listened to guidance. I felt as if I was being told that my ego was holding onto desire from the fear of not existing without it. That aimless desire was a cloak that muddled the hearts light and needed to be removed so the true will could clearly shine on the world. I am not my desire.

It was a much more intense experience than last time. I wish I had allowed myself to speak more.

LBRP, LBRH

feeling incredibly anxious and depressed today. Still struggling to get over my romantic disappointment- it all feels so alive to me. Not like grief but like I am actively being dragged over hot coals.

Performed LBRH with all my heart. Truly attempting to allow my old self to die and to be reborn as Osiris. 

Afterwards I sat in silent meditation for some time.

I feel better now. Anxiety is eased.

LBRP, meditation

in meditation had minor clarity on the importance of inner silence. If our hearts are like the lantern that illuminates the unformed field of possibilities around us- the mental chatter diffuses that light so that it can not make strong impressions. Important to be silent so that only the true will is making impressions on the field.
