#todo 

>“I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”
>- [[Niklas Luhman]]

**Notebook:** I use sequential journaling and Bujo techniques to use my journal as a record keeping inbox. Weekly review converts important info to digital form for LTS.

**Todoist**: Primary Digital inbox. All events, tasks, and ephemeral notes go in here to be sorted. Source of truth for daily tasks and Context tasks

**G-cal**: Source of truth for all events

**Hobonichi**: For time blocking days.

**Obsidian**: For long term storage of evergreen content

__Notion__ : Project management , ephemeral notes like desires, therapy notes, shopping wishlist 

__G-Keep__: Ephemeral notes, contacts,

_Can this be simplified? Can we remove one or more of these softwares and consolidate notes??_
### Note Flow

Read source -> [[source note]] -> splits into -> [[Lit Note]]s-> combine into -> [[Evergreen Note]] -> Related to other notes -> marked in index

Evergreen notes are then developed over time

As per [[Obsidian's Role in my PKMS]] , all notes should be in a state of movement towards permanence. No fleeting notes. (_This leaves an open question of what to do about daily notes. Perhaps they should be deleted- I will wait until it becomes a problem where they overwhelm search capacity 9/27/23 )_

## Goal and Project Flow
### Project Management
Have seasonal goals planned. Always see these setting up the week plan. look at week plan when setting up day plan.
### Project Flow
Note [[Desires]] during the day -> develop into Ideals -> Create goals that align with ideals -> create projects to complete goals  and objectives-> create objectives to track progress on goals

### Task Flow
Tasks all go into Todoist where they are dealt with in order per GTD
- One off tasks are labeled in context
- Projects get moved to Notion
- Tasks/events with dates are added to calendar / added to day in hobonichi 

[[Example of Integrating Notion and Todoist]]

## Potential Analogue Solutions

- ~~fleeting notes and tasks go to HPDA where they are dealt with per GTD / uploaded
- Fleeting notes and tasks go in notebook

## Separation of Personal Notes

There is some cross over in my obsidian vault of evergreen and personal notes / fleeting notes. This appears to happen in Andy Masutchack's notes as well, although he hides his personal notes behind a login. I see other creators that keep a slipbox as well as other notes and writing in the same vault and I would like to as well.

- [[Prefer Integrity over Strict Taxonomy for Knowledge Management]]

### Annual -> Seasonal -> Monthly -> Weekly -> Daily

__Annual__: Define and Align Ideals, Check [[5 year]]
__Seasonal__: Define Goals which align with Ideals 
__Monthly__: Define Projects which move towards Goals
__Weekly__: Decide on which Projects to prioritize
__Daily__: Decide on Tasks to complete
