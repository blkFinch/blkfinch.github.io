10 am

I performed the pentagram ritual then prayed to be filled with my hga. I imagined a gold meteor landing in my chest and sitting on a gold throne. I recited a small invocation in my mind:

> Take my left leg Take my right leg
Fill my belly so that you may eat
take my left arm to meter out compassion
and take my right to hand out justice
Take my throat that you may speak
and take my mind that you may think
> 

After doing this I felt myself speaking automatically. I told myself I am loved and to relax. My voice came out lighter and higher pitched then normal.
