Potentially an example of [[Hypersigils]] 

Here is Cave speaking on the matter

>“‘**‘Skeleton Tree’ certainly disturbed me** because there was so much in that record that suggested what went on happened. It explicitly forecasted the future, so much so that it was hard for many people to believe I had written almost all of the songs before Arthur died. The way it spoke about the events surrounding Arthur’s death was very distressing at the time.

>I’m not somebody who gets too engaged in this sort of thing. In the past, if someone had started talking to me in this way, I would have dismissed him or her entirely. I think you and I are similar in that regard, yet at the same time, **we are open to certain ambiguities in life**. We cautiously acknowledge that there are, I don’t know, mysteries.”
