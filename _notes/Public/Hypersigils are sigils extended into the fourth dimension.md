If [[Sigils are visually encoded desires]] then a hypersigil takes this concept and extends it through time by adding plot or narrative.

This means that the sigil is not a static image but a *seqence* wherein a representative object undergoes change. Typically this sigilized object represents the operator of the magic and the change is the intended [[Desire]]

>The “hypersigil” or “supersigil” develops the sigil concept beyond the static image and incorporates elements such as characterization, drama, and plot. The hypersigil is a sigil extended through the fourth dimension. My own comic book series The Invisibles  was a six-year long sigil in the form of an occult adventure story which consumed and recreated my life during the period of its composition and execution. The hypersigil is an immensely powerful and sometimes dangerous method for actually altering reality in accordance with intent. Results can be remarkable and shocking.
