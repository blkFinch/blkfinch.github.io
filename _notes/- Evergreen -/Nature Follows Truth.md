We can expand on the idea that [[Life imitates art]] , by saying that not only does life imitate art but in fact there is a causal relationship between material reality and Truth. 

If [[Kabbalah can reveal the universal truth in mundane objects]] we can then say that all material objects contain universal truth. So then if [[Truth precedes Nature]] and all of Nature contains truth we can say there is a 1 to 1 relation. Perhaps even a causal relationship.

This is the [[Holographic Universe]] . Wherein a single unit of our material reality contains all the information of the rest of the universe.
