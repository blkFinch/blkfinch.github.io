- long term storage -> develop notes into Evergreen notes
- _that's it!_

in an effort to [[Prefer Simplicity]] , this vault's sole purpose is to preserve information which is atomic and non-fleeting. Daily notes exist only as a reference.

Notes, and scripts that are stored in obsidian are ok for archival purposes, but __the point is to move all content  in this vault into a state that is usable and evergreen.__
