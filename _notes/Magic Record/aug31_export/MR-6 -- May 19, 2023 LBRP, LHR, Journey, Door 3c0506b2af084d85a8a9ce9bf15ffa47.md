Banished with both rituals of pentagram and hexagram. Then called for guidance and laid down to enter a trance.

After some time of laying in silence I felt more clear that my heart is ready to be in union with a partner that I view as an equal. I have protected myself from intimacy by seeking situations that would not allow for it.

I then rose, and drew a door in the air facing east. Through the door I imagined my life not as a solitary man but as part of a partnership with another. I then made an oath to allow myself to join with a partner and stepped through the door. 

For the rest of the evening I felt sort of bubbly and happy.
