Truth, as a concept is typically thought of as a *description of* nature. Nature is in a specific state or configuration and truth is an accurate account or representation of that state of nature. Imagine a box has a red ball in it. Many would say that *the box having the red ball in it* is the Truth - **This is not the case**. Lets consider the following example:

> A boy puts the red ball in the magician's chest. The magician asks him "What is in the chest" to which the boy responds **"A red ball"** -- but the magician opens the chest to reveal a blue ball. The red ball is nowhere to be seen.

In the above example *did the boy tell the truth* ? Intuitively we can see that the boy was *Truthful* when asked a question- as in he answered to the best of his knowledge.  We can see then that Truth exists beyond the state of nature.

If truth and nature are linked- then it is not possible for truth to be in opposition to nature. If the truth were not connected to nature in some way we would say it was false.

Truth then must precede nature in the same way that [[Action is preceded by desire]] and how [[Life imitates art]] . That every state of nature has a causal relation to some other state of nature- and we can trace back these states of nature to some pre-natural cause which we can call Truth.
