A broad collection of esoteric traditions, that claim to be founded in the same spiritual principles. A form of [[Magic]] and spirituality that is diverse in Practice but purports to be aligned in belief.

### The Core Beliefs

- Divinity is accessible from within every person
- The entire material world is a projection of the spiritual world
- The spiritual practice is to unite the divinity within us to the greater divinity of the universe and then return this divinity back to earth like _Prometheus bringing fire to earth_
