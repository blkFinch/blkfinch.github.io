*Wake Induced  Lucid Dream*

This method is simple, but there are many tips and variations to help it. Here are the basic steps:
1. Be relaxed and ready for sleep - Best time to attempt is after 4-6 hours of sleep
2. *Do Not Move-- the body may attempt to make you move but relax and allow it to fall asleep. Breathing should become automatic-- these are good signs*
3. Lie on back and relax body. Quiet mind. Observe hypnagogic state
4. Enter into dream

Step 3 above can be done in several different ways. Most often the suggestion is to use visualization. Start with visualizing a shape, then move to more complex images, until you are imagining yourself in a fully embodied scene.

*Alternatively -- this would be a good time to attempt an OBE* [[Mental, Astral, and Etheric projection]]

>1.  After at least four and a half hours of sleep, wake yourself up and write down your dreams. Then set your intent to gain lucidity, close your eyes and allow yourself to drift back into sleep.
>2.  As you enter the hypnagogic state, gently focus your mental awareness on the hypnagogic imagery and simply float through it, allowing it to build, layer upon layer. The key here is to maintain a delicate vigilance without blacking out and being sucked into the dream state unconsciously.
>3.  Don’t engage the hypnagogic imagery that'll arise, but don't reject it either. Just lie there watching it until the dreamscape has been formed sufficiently for you to drop into it consciously. If you feel yourself blacking out, just keep bringing your focus back to the hypnagogic imagery. It'll continue to build, layer upon layer, until it starts to coalesce into an actual dreamscape. This is a wonderful thing to witness.
>4.  As the dreamscape solidifies, you might feel a slight pull or a sensation of being sucked forwards. This is an indication that the wave of the dream is now fully formed. In surfing terms, you're on point break.
>5.  If you can just stay conscious for a few more moments, and are ready to take the plunge, you'll find yourself dropping into the wave of the dream with full lucidity.
