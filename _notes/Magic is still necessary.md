## Do we need magic anymore?

Ever since the [[New Thought]] movement- gurus have gotten very good at providing streamlined tools for manifesting desires. Thanks to [[Chaos Magick]], we have seen that many older techniques and rituals are really not needed to see results.

IF the only reason you do magic is to see results in your life, it is probably simply much easier to watch some productivity you tube videos and apply the basic techniques:
- Self Hypnosis
- Visualization
- Metaprogramming (belief hacking)

There are myriad ways to bring into reality a desired result and few of them require daily ritual practice and the memorization of countless symbols and connections.

So why would Western style magic still be relevant?

## Magic Aligns us with our true will

If we have the power to manifest anything-- _what should we manifest?_

this is where magic can help us, as [[The central operation of Magic is the alignment of the magician with their true will]] 

Magic will connect us to our true will so we are not aimlessly applying ourselves to achieving [[False ego]] desires.
