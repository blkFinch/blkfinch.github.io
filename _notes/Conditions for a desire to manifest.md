**For [[Desires]] to manifest they must meet both these conditions:**

1.  I must believe it is possible in material reality
2.  I must be willing to accept the result NOW (not soon or someday but I must be willing to receive the result immediately)

[[For magic to work the result must be possible]] 

These are accepted occult theory - part 1 was suggested by Crowley in Magick in Theory and Practice as well as Levi and other contemporary occultists. Part 2 is a fundamental theory of Manifestation (the secret, transurfing, etc..) both these theories seem to hold true in many people’s personal experiences.


#todo find refs for this. should be some in [[Crowley, Book Four]] , Levi, Chaos Protocols, transurfing

>Another gem of wisdom from the mind of the man whose been there before.
Don't enchant for something and then DO NOTHING about it. You can't meet the
man/woman of your dreams by sitting at home all night, you can't pass that
physics test by not studying. You can't get a big pay raise by always
showing up late for work etc.. As your workings become progressively more
difficult seek to tip the hand of chance by creating "avenues of
manifestation" � help the universe give you what you want.
