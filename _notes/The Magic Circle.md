*The magic circle is the space where normal rules and reality are suspended and replaced by the super natural/artificial rules of a synthetic reality.*
This can refer to the space within a game, or to the space within a magical ritual.

*The Magic Circle* also contains a three-part symbolism:
- It represents __The Infinite__ as it is continuous
- It represents __Balance__ as every point around the edge is an equal distance from the center
- It represents __Limitation__ as it seperates the magician from the mundane world and affirms his oath towards the great work

> He chooses a circle rather than any other lineal figure for many reasons; e.g., 1. He affirms thereby his identity with the infinite.
 >2. He affirms the equal balance of his working; since all points on the circumference are equidistant from the centre.
>  3. He affirms the limitation implied by his devotion to the Great Work. He no longer wanders about aimlessly in the world.
