While this technique is specific to the [[Evocation]] of [[The Succubus as a Dream Initiator]] it could be adapted to evoke any existing entity or manufacted entity within a dream. Simply apply the Evocation steps to your desired entity.

### Creating the Succubus
*This is an adaptation of* [[Creating an Internal Conscious Being]] :

- **Gestate:** Create the succubus by choosing appropriate images, name, and designing a sigil -- *or adapt one of the existing spirits for this purpose*
- Design a cohesive symbology for this succubus. It should resonate with your subconscious mind
- **Birth:** Combine the symbols into an erotic image which becomes the focus for a meditation. Build charge through masturbation, then upon orgasm silence all thoughts and focus on the image to *seal* it. (consider using [[Vajroli Mudra (Non-Ejaculatory Orgasm)]])
- *perform the birthing ritual from New Moon to Full Moon every night preferably at 3 am* 

### Evoking the Succubus

1. Prepare the space where you sleep by [[Banishing]] and then surrounding your bed with images related to the entity you wish to evoke
2. Using the [[WILD method]] -- enter into the hypnagogic state
3. Visualize the Sigil of the entity as you enter into the dream
