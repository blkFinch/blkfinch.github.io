## Individualism is an Assumption
Typically in american culture and other secularized and capitalistic cultures, we make the assumption of the individual.

We are parts of a larger web and with that comes a responsibility to participate and give to the network. This stands in contrast to modern, secular individualism which centers the individual and their personal well being over the collective.

## Psychologization of the World
Because we live in a secular world, psychology becomes the only answer for what were once considered spiritual maladies and experiences. With this comes a pathologizing of all experiences which fall outside the framework of capitalism and how we fit into that system (as either owners of capital or as proletariat) become pathologized as _abnormal_ or _unwell_.

> The DSM-V is the modern day _Witches Hammer_ or _malleus maleficarum_ 

> this is like diagnosis a wilting plant with _wilting plant syndrome_ rather than looking at the soil and the water.

__capitalism benefits from the individualization of wellness because it distracts from seeing the environmental reasons for unwellness.__

#### Can someone with no cultural connection to ritual or ceremony develop a ritual system that can orient them to a collective experience?
Yes, I believe so. While most living ceremonies and rituals are handed down through shared culture- I believe a person with no cultural context for ceremony can develop one. In fact _must develop a context for ceremony_
